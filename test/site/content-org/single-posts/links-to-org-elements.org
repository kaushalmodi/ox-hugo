* Links to source blocks

From [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-Links.html][(org) Internal Links]],

#+begin_quote
   If no dedicated target exists, the link will then try to match the
exact name of an element within the buffer.  Naming is done with the
‘#+name’ keyword, which has to be put in the line before the element it
refers to, as in the following example
    #+begin_example
    ,#+name: My Target
    | a  | table      |
    |----+------------|
    | of | four cells |
    #+end_example
#+end_quote

Also, when targeting a =#+name= keyword, *=#+caption= keyword is
mandatory in order to get proper numbering* for _source blocks_,
_images_ and _tables_.

So the below code block:
#+begin_src org
,#+caption: Hello
,#+name: code__hello
,#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(message "Hello")
,#+end_src

,*Here we refer to [[code__helloagain]].*

,#+include: "../misc/common.org::#lorem-ipsum" :only-contents t

,#+caption: Hello Again
,#+name: code__helloagain
,#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(message "Hello again")
,#+end_src

,*Here we refer to [[code__hello]].*
#+end_src

will output below (/lorem-ipsum/ added to increase page content so
that the link jump is evident):

#+caption: Hello
#+name: code__hello
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(message "Hello")
#+end_src

*Here we refer to [[code__helloagain]].*

#+include: "../misc/common.org::#lorem-ipsum" :only-contents t

#+caption: Hello Again
#+name: code__helloagain
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(message "Hello again")
#+end_src

*Here we refer to [[code__hello]].*
* Links to tables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: links-to-tables
:END:
*Note*: When targeting a =#+name= keyword, *=#+caption= keyword is
mandatory in order to get proper numbering* for _source blocks_,
_images_ and _tables_.

#+begin_src org
,#+caption: Simple table 1
,#+name: tab__simple1
| a | b |
| c | d |

,*Here we refer to [[tab__simple2]].*

,#+include: "../misc/common.org::#lorem-ipsum" :only-contents t

Here's another table:

,#+caption: Simple table 2
,#+name: tab__simple2
| e | f |
| g | h |

,*Here we refer to [[tab__simple1]].*
#+end_src

will output below (/lorem-ipsum/ added to increase page content so
that the link jump is evident):

#+caption: Simple table 1
#+name: tab__simple1
| a | b |
| c | d |

*Here we refer to [[tab__simple2]].*

#+include: "../misc/common.org::#lorem-ipsum" :only-contents t

Here's another table:

#+caption: Simple table 2
#+name: tab__simple2
| e | f |
| g | h |

*Here we refer to [[tab__simple1]].*

* Links to images
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: links-to-images
:END:
*Note*: When targeting a =#+name= keyword, *=#+caption= keyword is
mandatory in order to get proper numbering* for _source blocks_,
_images_ and _tables_.

#+begin_src org
,#+caption: Org Logo
,#+name: img__org_logo1
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png]]

,*Here we refer to [[img__org_logo2]].*

,#+include: "../misc/common.org::#lorem-ipsum" :only-contents t

Here's the same image again, but with a different Org link ID:

,#+caption: Same Org Logo
,#+name: img__org_logo2
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png]]

,*Here we refer to [[img__org_logo1]].*
#+end_src

will output below (/lorem-ipsum/ added to increase page content so
that the link jump is evident):

#+caption: Org Logo
#+name: img__org_logo1
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png]]

*Here we refer to [[img__org_logo2]].*

#+include: "../misc/common.org::#lorem-ipsum" :only-contents t

Here's the same image again, but with a different Org link ID:

#+caption: Same Org Logo
#+name: img__org_logo2
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo.png]]

*Here we refer to [[img__org_logo1]].*
