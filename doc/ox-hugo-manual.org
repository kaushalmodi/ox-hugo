** COMMENT v
*** Features
*** Backward-incompatible changes
*** Fixes
*** Meta
** v0.8 <2018-01-26 Fri>
*** Features
- Support exporting content files and attachments (images, documents)
  to Page Bundles organization structure (Hugo v0.32+) --
  {{{issue(111)}}}.
- Support exporting =resources= front-matter (Hugo v0.33+) --
  {{{issue(115)}}}.
- Support exporting =headless= front-matter (Hugo v0.35+).
- Advanced table styling is now possible by specifying =#+attr_html=
  and =#+attr_css= (this one is unique to =ox-hugo=) above Org
  tables. See its [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/table-styling/][documentation]] -- {{{issue(93)}}}.
  - Similarly, support =#+attr_html= and =#+attr_css= for paragraphs,
    example blocks, source blocks, plain lists and quote blocks too --
    {{{issue(113)}}}.
- Now =publishDate= and =expiryDate= front-matter properties get
  auto-derived from =SCHEDULED= and =DEADLINE= special properties if
  associated with the valid Hugo post subtree --
  {{{commit(0807f42d)}}}.
  - Date values can now be easily set using the =C-c .= binding in the
    =HUGO_PUBLISHDATE= and =HUGO_EXPIRYDATE= properties too.
- Export source blocks and table captions -- {{{issue(38)}}}. Here's a
  suggested CSS for the captions:
  #+begin_src css
  figcaption,
  .src-block-caption,
  .table-caption {
      font-style: italic;
      text-align: center;
  }
  #+end_src
- Export descriptive or definition lists in Blackfriday-friendly
  Markdown format -- {{{issue(114)}}}.
- Support Org Special Blocks like in HTML and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-blocks-in-LaTeX-export.html][LaTeX exports]] --
  {{{issue(105)}}}. Here's one little example:
  #+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_mark
  /Some/ *marked* text
  ,#+end_mark
  #+end_src
- Allow setting =:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION:= in the valid Hugo post subtree
  itself.
- Enable replacing any key in the front-matter with anything; it's
  even possible to swap the keys now (tags↔categories:
  {{{commit(fb21e82c)}}}). New keyword:
  =HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_KEY_REPLACE= -- see {{{commit(b72a5fb0)}}}.
- Now all the Org keyword values that should get merged, get merged --
  {{{commit(38eba6d5)}}}.
- Add =title= as a valid property of =menu= front-matter (Hugo
  v0.32+).
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- A "better user-experience" change.. now you do not need to use
  /double-underscores/ as /space/ replacement in =#+hugo_tags=,
  =#+hugo_categories= and =#+keywords=. See this commit for details
  and examples -- {{{commit(319435db)}}}.
*** Fixes
- Fix =HUGO_LEVEL_OFFSET= not getting set -- {{{issue(117)}}}, thanks
  {{{user(shimmy1996)}}}!
- Fix internal subtree counter not getting reset after a file-based
  export.
- Fix clickable image links with =#+name= -- {{{commit(fef0ec50)}}}.
- Make title text rendering more robust.. now Markdown markup
  characters like =*=, =_= and =`= show up fine, verbatim, in the
  title.
- Make em dash, en dash, horizontal ellipsis render in post titles
  too -- {{{hugoissue(4175)}}} (/Upstream bug fix/), and in source
  block captions and table captions too.
- Fix double-escaping of =#= and =![= in Markdown export --
  {{{issue(110)}}} (/fix in upstream =ox-md.el=/).
*** Meta
- Re-write the logic for parsing meta-data for various kinds of dates,
  and optimize the logic for parsing newline separated lists like tags
  and categories.
- The =hugo-bare-min-theme= used for the test site is made more
  portable (at some point, that theme might be moved to a separate
  repo).
** v0.7 <2017-12-18 Mon>
*** Features
- *Now C-c C-e H H works for both per-subtree and per-file flows* --
  {{{commit(b1b5d28b)}}}.
- Support Org heading based internal links -- {{{issue(88)}}}.
- Support list values for custom front-matter variables --
  {{{issue(99)}}}.
- Support specifying multiple [[https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/][hugo output formats]] .. Now the =outputs=
  front-matter variable is a list.
- Support the Org =#+author= and =#+creator= keywords and their
  respective Org Export Options -- {{{issue(106)}}}.
- Support Org Export Snippets and Export Blocks --
  {{{commit(1149f20cd)}}}.
- Now post titles can be set to =nil= i.e. be not be a part of the
  front-matter .. /because you can/.
- Improve the messages printed by =ox-hugo= on doing per-subtree or
  per-file exports.. the progress of files exported using per-subtree
  flow is now clearer, and the name of the file exported using
  per-file flow is now explicit.. Helps when you batch export a dozen
  files with a mix of these 2 flows.
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Obsolete /org-hugo-export-subtree-\ast{}/ functions and replace them with
  /org-hugo-export-wim-\ast{}/ (What I Mean) functions. See the doc string
  of =org-hugo-export-wim-to-md= for details.

  If you are using the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving/][Auto-export on saving]] flow, note the function
  name change there too!
*** Fixes
- Fix number of backticks in code fence when code contains code fence
  (/pathological corner case/).
- Better document the =HUGO_CODE_FENCE= keyword -- {{{issue(102)}}}.
- Don't render =(c)=, =(r)=, =(tm)= inside Latex equations --
  {{{issue(104)}}} (/Upstream bug workaround/).
- Better recognition of TOML-compatible integers and floats in meta
  data for front-matter so that valid integers/floats don't get
  unnecessarily double-quoted.
*** Meta
- Add a [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-debugprint/blob/master/layouts/partials/debugprint.html][=debugprint.html=]] partial to help pretty-print various Hugo
  objects like Page Params, File and SiteInfo for debug on the test
  site.
- The test site now has [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/tags/][tags]] and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/categories/][categories]] pages.
- Add few real world example posts containing complex Latex equations:
  [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/real-examples/multifractals-in-ecology-using-r/][1]], [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/real-examples/nn-intro/][2]].
- Turns out =ox-hugo= works on emacs 24.4 too (/but please upgrade
  to the latest Emacs and Org stable versions!/).
** v0.6 <2017-11-09 Thu>
*** Features
- Support the =num= export option. Now you can prefix all post
  headings (or some not.. the ones with =UNNUMBERED= property set to
  =t=) with their section numbers -- {{{issue(76)}}}.
- Org TOC's are now exported as unordered Markdown lists. This allows
  having TOC's with unnumbered headings too! This also enables
  prefixing the section headings with their full section numbers, and
  also having only selected headings unnumbered (both in the post body
  and the TOC).
- Add support for exporting internal links to source blocks, tables
  and images by their block names! -- {{{issue(29)}}}.
- Org table column alignment markers (=<l>=, =<r>=, =<c>=) are now
  exported to equivalent Markdown tables.. so a center-aligned column
  in Org buffer will remain center-aligned in the final HTML too! --
  {{{issue(95)}}}.
- Allow setting multiple Hugo aliases for a post. Also infer the
  section name from inherited =HUGO_SECTION= values (subtree-based
  exports) for those alias prefixes.
- Prevent a footnote ref to appear by itself on a newline (based on
  wrapping) in the browser -- {{{issue(96)}}}.
- If Hugo shortcodes are used specifically in Markdown (=md=) source
  blocks, they will be auto-escaped (useful when you want to
  document/talk about some Hugo shortcode in a blog post) --
  {{{issue(94)}}}.
- If an Org table has just 1 row, don't make it render as a header row
  in the final HTML.
- If you have a case where you need to have an Org source block
  instead a quote block, and then a source block after that quote
  block (/I know, a very common case../ :wink:), Blackfriday barfs
  ({{{bfissue(407)}}}). But we now have a workaround, which /just
  works/ -- {{{issue(98)}}}.
- Now =ATTR_HTML= above even hyper-linked images works (earlier it
  worked only above non-hyper-linked images).
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Org TOC's are exported as unordered Markdown lists instead of
  ordered Markdown lists, and now full section numbers (like 1.2.3)
  are shown in the TOC instead of just the last digit (like 3.) --
  {{{commit(4be378e7)}}}.
- The =num= Org export option is default to =nil= (only for
  =ox-hugo=). So Org TOC's are exported without section numbers by
  default. To get section numbers, set =num= to =t= or =onlytoc=.
*** Fixes
- Now exporting 1-row Org tables works too.
- Add missing http/https/ftp prefix for hyper-linked images.
*** Meta
- Add documentation on how you can have
  {{{doc(images-in-content,,Images live in the same directory as Org
  source)}}} -- {{{issue(91)}}}.
- Now only Org files for the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][documentation site]] need to be committed
  to git. =ox-hugo= then exports those to Markdown, and then Hugo
  publishes those to HTML (as before) --- all on Netlify.
- Be sure to check out the moderately revamped [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/][Test Site]]. That might
  be of interest even if you want to check out what the new features
  and changes look like, without first installing/updating =ox-hugo=
  yourself :smile:.
** v0.5 <2017-11-06 Mon>
*** Features
- Export TOC as a Markdown ordered list. See {{{doc(org-toc,,Table of
  Contents)}}} -- {{{issue(88)}}}.
- =#+attr_html= above http/https/ftp links is now supported (useful
  for specifying the =target=, =rel=, attributes, for example).
** v0.4.1 <2017-10-29 Sun>
*** Features
- Support specifying the =:height= parameter in the =#+attr_html=
  above image links. That eventually gets transformed to the =height=
  parameter in the =figure= tag in the HTML generated by Hugo. This
  feature requires building Hugo from its master branch with commit
  [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/488631fe0abc3667355345c7eb98ba7a2204deb5][488631fe]] (or Hugo v0.31+).
*** Fixes
- Fix =EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION= not getting inherited {{{issue(90)}}}.
** v0.4 <2017-10-28 Sat>
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Restore the default Org behavior of =#+tags=. Now that keyword (and
  the =EXPORT_TAGS= property) is *not* used by =ox-hugo=. Fixes
  {{{issue(89)}}}.
- File-based exports must now use =#+hugo_tags= to set the post tags.
- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_TAGS= property to
  override Org-style tags on the same headline (and the ones inherited
  from Org-style tags from any of the parent subtrees and
  =#+filetags=).
  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+filetags= can be used to
    set tags globally in the file. Earlier =#+tags= was used for that
    purpose.
- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_CATEGORIES= property
  to override Org-style categories (tags with "@" prefix) on the same
  headline (and the ones inherited from Org-style categories from any
  of the parent subtrees and =#+filetags=).
  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+filetags= can be used to
    set categories (tags with "@") globally in the file.

See the new section added to documentation:
{{{doc(tags-and-categories,,*Tags and Categories*)}}}
*** Features
- Support specifying the =:width= parameter in the =#+attr_html= above
  image links. That eventually gets transformed to the =width=
  parameter in the =figure= tag in the HTML generated by Hugo.
** v0.3.2 <2017-10-24 Tue>
*** Fixes
- Fix issue with headline metadata parsing (ALLTAGS, CLOSED, TODO)
  when a post Org heading was immediately followed by that post's
  sub-heading.  This issue was seen in subtree-based exports
  {{{issue(87)}}}.
** v0.3.1 <2017-10-19 Thu>
*** Fixes
- Fix the source block line number annotation when the line numbers
  increased in number of digits in the same code block.
** v0.3 <2017-10-18 Wed>
*** Features
- Source blocks can now be exported with line numbers and/or
  highlighting!

  See {{{doc(source-blocks,,Source Blocks)}}} for details.
** v0.2.3 <2017-10-11 Wed>
*** Fixes
- =org-hugo-slug= earlier stripped off only the =code= HTML tag
  (~<code> .. </code>~) from the input string, if present. Now it does
  that for *any* HTML tag, like =span=. For example, this HTML gets
  stripped off from the above heading (only inside =org-hugo-slug=
  when deriving the slug string): ~<span
  class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2017-10-11
  Wed&gt;</span></span>~.
** v0.2.2 <2017-10-10 Tue>
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Now =ox-hugo= by default requires text, to be sub/super-scripted, to
  be wrapped in ={}=. So now =a_b= will be exported as =a_b=, but
  =a_{b}= will be exported as =a<sub>b</sub>=. To revert back to the
  earlier behavior, user needs to add =#+options: ^:t= to their Org
  file.
** v0.2.1 <2017-09-28 Thu>
*** Fixes
- Single column tables now export correctly {{{issue(84)}}}.
- Ignore =HUGO_WEIGHT= set to =auto= for /per-file/ exports
  {{{issue(83)}}}.
** v0.2 <2017-09-27 Wed>
*** Features
- Add support for all Hugo =figure= shortcode parameters
  {{{issue(79)}}}.
- New option =org-hugo-delete-trailing-ws= defaults to =t=; now Hugo
  deletes trailing white-spaces by default.
- New options =org-hugo-default-static-subdirectory-for-externals= and
  =org-hugo-external-file-extensions-allowed-for-copying= (related to
  {{{issue(69)}}}).
*** Fixes
- Remove =HUGO_STATIC_IMAGE= option; fix attachment re-write
  {{{issue(69)}}}.
- Fix incorrectly inserted hard line-breaks {{{issue(72)}}}. Added a
  new option =HUGO_PRESERVE_FILLING=.
- Fix error happening when a post title was set to an empty string
  [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/ba9e8365f6ee42f030ed806bf5ec42d6acce4c76][ba9e8365]]].
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Switch the default value of =org-hugo-use-code-for-kbd= option to
  =nil= [[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/88ba15ae9bc809b0983315446c88fecfda3534e5][88ba15ae]]].
** v0.1.3 <2017-09-13 Wed>
- Now a HUGO key value set to ="nil"=, like =#+hugo_code_fence: nil=,
  will evaluate as /nil/ instead of /t/, as now
  =org-hugo--plist-get-true-p= is used to parse boolean keys instead
  of =plist-get=.
** v0.1.2 <2017-09-12 Tue>
- Make DateTime matching better; new internal variable
  =org-hugo--date-time-regexp=. Earlier time zones ahead of UTC (with
  =+= sign) were not detected as dates in =org-hugo--quote-string= and
  thus were unnecessarily quoted.
** v0.1.1 <2017-09-11 Mon>
- Use CLOSED log drawer info if available to set the date in
  front-matter {{{issue(68)}}}.
- Code optimization: Use of =org-entry-get= at places instead of
  maintaining global variables.

There is a plan to create a =hugo.el= that would do things like:
- New post creation using =org-capture= (port code from [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d/blob/master/setup-files/setup-hugo.el][here]]).
- Interactive functions to toggle /draft/ state,
  add/remove/increment/decrement /publishdate/ property.
- Option to use template =config.toml= and some default hugo theme. So
  all a new user would need to do is to (i) have the =hugo= [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases][binary]] in
  =PATH= (ii) define their =hugo= blog dir in the =defcustom= (iii)
  =M-x hugo=.
- Set separate faces for titles based on /draft/ state and
  /futureness/.

** Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:END:
=ox-hugo= is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to
[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]-compatible Markdown ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]]) and also generates the
front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

The =ox-hugo= backend extends from a /parent/ backend
=ox-blackfriday.el=. The latter is the one that primarily does the
Blackfriday-friendly Markdown content generation. The main job of
=ox-hugo= is to generate the front-matter for each exported content
file, and then append that generated Markdown to it.

There are, though, few functions that =ox-hugo.el= overrides over
those by =ox-blackfriday.el=.
** Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:
This package requires emacs 24.4+ and Org 9.0+. It is available on
Melpa ([[https://melpa.org/#/ox-hugo]]).
** Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:
Once the package is installed, you will need to /require/ it so that
the =ox-hugo= export options are available in the /Org Export
Dispatcher/ menu (the one you see when you hit =C-c C-e= to initiate
any export).

You can do that by adding the below to your config:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'ox
  (require 'ox-hugo))
(require 'ox-hugo-auto-export) ;If you want the auto-exporting on file saves
#+end_src
If you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][=use-package=]], you can do the below instead:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref use_package_snippet
(use-package ox-hugo
  :ensure t            ;Auto-install the package from Melpa (optional)
  :after ox)
(use-package ox-hugo-auto-export) ;If you want the auto-exporting on file saves
#+end_src

Also see the {{{doc(auto-export-on-saving,,Auto Exporting)}}} section.

*Spacemacs*

Spacemacs users can choose to add this snippet to their
=dotspacemacs/user-config= function in =.spacemacs=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  ;; Other stuff
  ;; ..

  ;; ox-hugo config
  <<use_package_snippet>>
  )
#+end_src

#+begin_note
You do have _have_ to use the =use-package= version when using
Spacemacs. That version was used because =use-package= is installed by
default in Spacemacs.
#+end_note
If you do so, you *also need to* add =ox-hugo= to
=dotspacemacs-additional-packages=.

/This was verified to work on Spacemacs =develop= branch with
=spacemacs-base= distribution, =emacs= editing style. --
<2017-10-09 Mon>/
*** Before you export
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: before-you-export
:END:
Before you export check that these properties are set as you need:
- HUGO_SECTION :: The default Hugo section name for all the posts.  See
                  [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/][here]] for more information on Hugo sections.  It is
                  common for this property to be set to =posts= or
                  =blog=.  The default value is set using
                  =org-hugo-default-section-directory=. See
                  {{{doc(hugo-section,,Hugo Section)}}} for details.
- HUGO_BASE_DIR :: Root directory of the source for the Hugo site. If
                   this is set to =~/hugo/=, the exported Markdown
                   files will be saved to
                   =~/hugo/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/=
                   directory[fn:section_more].  By default, the
                   Markdown files reside in a hierarchy under the
                   =content/= directory in the site root directory
                   ([[https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/][ref]]). If you try to export without setting this
                   property, you will get this error:
  #+begin_example
  user-error: It is mandatory to set the HUGO_BASE_DIR property
  #+end_example

*Important*: If you choose to export an Org subtree as a post, you
 need to set the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= subtree property. That property is
 used by this package to figure out where the current post starts.

[fn:section_more] The ~HUGO_SECTION~ is the bare-minimum requirement
to specify the destination path. That path can be further tweaked
using ~HUGO_BUNDLE~ key (and the associated ~EXPORT_HUGO_BUNDLE~
property), and the ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~ property (only for
/per-subtree/ exports).
*** Export bindings
The common =ox-hugo= export bindings are:
**** For both one-post-per-subtree and one-post-per-file flows
- =C-c C-e H H= :: Export "What I Mean".
  - If point is in a /valid Hugo post subtree/, export that
    subtree to a Hugo post in Markdown.

    A /valid Hugo post subtree/ is an Org subtree has the
    =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property set.
  - If the file is intended to be exported as a whole (i.e. has the
    =#+title= keyword), export the whole Org file to a Hugo post in
    Markdown.
- =C-c C-e H A= :: Export *all* "What I Mean"
  - If the Org file has one or more 'valid Hugo post subtrees', export
    them to Hugo posts in Markdown.
  - If the file is intended to be exported as a whole (i.e. no 'valid
    Hugo post subtrees' at all, and has the =#+title= keyword), export
    the whole Org file to a Hugo post in Markdown.
**** For only the one-post-per-file flow
- =C-c C-e H h= :: Export the Org file to a Hugo post in Markdown.

*** Editorial
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-blogging-flow-editorial
:END:
The preferred way to organize the posts is as Org subtrees (also the
main reason to write this package, as nothing like that was out there)
as it makes the meta-data management for Hugo front-matter pretty
effortless.

If you are a /one Org-file per post/ type of a person, that flow works
too! Just note that in this flow many of those =#+hugo_= properties
need to be managed manually.. just as one would manage the front-matter
in Markdown files --- See the Org versions in the above screenshots for
comparison.

The test site uses a [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme][minimal]] theme written just for debug purposes
(not extra aesthetics). The test site is designed to verify if all the
content translates from Org to Markdown as expected.

*** Contribute to documentation
{{{doc_site_min_hugo_version}}}

1. Clone this repo.
2. Add/edit documentation to =doc/ox-hugo-manual.org=.
3. Run =make doc=.
   - This generates the Markdown files for the =ox-hugo= documentation
     site and the .org files like =README.org= and =CONTRIBUTING.org=
     for GitHub.
4. Review the changes in the generated .org and .md files.
5. Commit *only the .org files*, push branch and create PR.
   - The =.org= → =.md= conversion is done by =ox-hugo= on Netlify.
*** Contribute to code
#+begin_note
While the end-user does not need Pandoc installed on their machine, a
code contributor needs to have both ~pandoc~ and ~pandoc-citeproc~
installed[fn:local1].

These are needed for ~make md~ and ~make -j1 test~ steps to work as
they use/test the {{{doc(pandoc-citations,,Pandoc Citations)}}} feature
too.
#+end_note

{{{doc_site_min_hugo_version}}}

1. Clone this repo.
2. Add/edit the .el files, *tests* in =test/site/content-org/=, and
   *documentation* to =doc/ox-hugo-manual.org=.
3. Run =make md doc=.
4. Review the changes in the generated .org and .md files.
   - Ignore the changes shown in =git diff= related to *only* the
     randomly generated Org ID's (like =org17de7a9=).
5. Commit (*don't push your branch yet!*).
   - As mentioned above, commit *only the .org files* for documentation.
6. Run test: =make -j1 test= (you *need* to =git commit= i.e. do the
   above step before this step).
7. Fix your commit(s) if the test fails.. repeat till you succeed.
8. Push your feature branch and create PR.

# Below footnote was copied manually from [fn:7] because otherwise
# #+include of just this subtree does not work.
[fn:local1] The Pandoc Citations feature was last <2018-08-19 Sun>
tested with Pandoc version {{{pandoc_version}}}. If you are running an
older version, the quickest way to install might be to simply download
the latest release archive from [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases][Pandoc releases]], extract it and put
the ~pandoc~ and ~pandoc-citeproc~ binaries in one of the directories
in your /PATH/.
** Debug
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: debug

So let me show you this screenshot that took on my phone (running
Emacs in Termux app on Android), showing the single Org file that
serves as a source of this whole documentation site.

{{{imageclick(ox-hugo-doc-source-viewing-in-Termux-Android.png)}}}

-----

Using Org just as a markup like Markdown is a miniscule part of
its complete feature-set. Org also allows stuff like:
- Easy ordering/manipulation/commenting of subtrees
- Creating tables (with even formulas like in Excel)
- Directly including source code snippets from external files (instead
  of having to copy/paste them in)
- Running code snippets within the Org file and embedding the results
  (Org Babel)
- ..

Using Org for content writing allows using in-built Org features to
translate to Hugo front-matter:

- Org uses an outline structure and can inherit meta data (tags and
  properties) from one subtree to children subtrees.
- Using that feature, one can tag one tree as /emacs/, and everything
  under that tree (all posts under that) will get that tag
  automatically.
- The same concept applies to inheriting any Org /property/ meta data
  like menu entry, category, section name, etc.
- A subtree can be quickly marked to be in TODO state (default binding
  =C-c C-t=). A *TODO* post is marked as a /draft/ Hugo post.
- The /menu-item weights/, /page weights/ and /taxonomy weights/ can
  be set to be auto-calculated so that the menu items or post order in
  the final HTML appear in the same order as the respective subtrees
  in Org.

  If the subtrees are re-ordered in Org, the weights get changed too.
- One can have a subtree with section property set to "posts" and all
  post subtrees under that will go to that section. Similarly another
  parent subtree can have that property set to "articles", and so on.
- Images can be displayed inline in the Org buffer.
- After save hooks can be set up in Emacs so that each time I save the
  file, only the current subtree in Org gets exported to
  Markdown. With the Hugo server running with the
  =--navigateToChanged= switch (this allows auto-changing the preview
  to the last changed post), the flow is seamless -- Save the Org file
  and see the exact changed post in browser.
- *All* posts can simply be subtrees in a single Org file. That way
  one can take advantage of Org subtree filtering and searching
  functions (=org-sparse-tree= bound to =C-c /= by default).
- (and much more..)
*** Do I need to re-write my whole blog in Org?
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: do-I-need-to-re-write-my-whole-blog-in-org
:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU_OVERRIDE: :title "Need to re-write my blog?"

If you are considering to try out =ox-hugo=, and if you have already
been using Hugo, it is normal for this thought to cross your mind:
#+begin_quote
I already have dozens or hundreds of posts written in Markdown. Do I
need to convert them to Org if I want to start using =ox-hugo=?
#+end_quote

The answer is *No*.

This package will export your future posts written in Org to
Markdown. And those files will live along with your already written
Markdown posts. So converting existing Markdown files to Org would be
purely the user's choice, your choice -- but that's by no means a
necessity if you want to start using =ox-hugo=.

.. And if at some point, you want to stop using =ox-hugo=, you still
have the exported Markdown files.

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: how-do-I-try-it
:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU_OVERRIDE: :title "Try it on my site?"
:END:
1. =cd= to your Hugo site base directory -- the one that contains the
   =config.toml= (or =config.yaml= or =config.json=).
2. Start the =hugo server= in that directory:
   #+begin_example
   hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
   #+end_example
3. Above command will mention the localhost where the site is
   served. Open that in your browser.
4. Create a separate directory for Org content in the Hugo site base
   directory. You can name it anything, but I prefer to name it
   =content-org=

   Examples ---
   - [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/doc][=ox-hugo= documentation site (you're reading it)]]
   - [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site][=ox-hugo= test site]]
   - [[https://gitlab.com/kaushalmodi/kaushalmodi.gitlab.io][/scripter.co/ -- My blog]]
5. Create an Org file in there and follow the {{{doc(usage,,*Usage*)}}}
   section to export it.
*** Blogging Flow
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: blogging-flow
:END:
There are 2 major blogging flows that can be used with this package:
1. One post per Org subtree (preferred)
   - Export only the *current* post Org subtree, or
   - Export all valid Hugo post subtrees in a loop.
2. One post per Org file
   - This works but you won't be able to leverage Org-specific
     benefits like tag and property inheritance, use of TODO states to
     translate to post =draft= state, auto weight calculation for
     pages, taxonomies and menu items, etc.

See the {{{doc(org-capture-setup,,Org Capture Setup)}}} page to see how
to quickly create new posts.

See the {{{doc(auto-export-on-saving,,Auto-export on Saving)}}} page to
learn how to setup up seeing live-preview of the Hugo-rendered HTML
each time you do =C-x C-s= in the Org file. That section explains how
to set that up for either of the above two blogging flows.

*** Hugo test site for this package
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: tests-site
:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU_OVERRIDE: :title "Try the test site"
:END:
A [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site][site]] with bare-bones Hugo "theme" is used to live-test the
package --- you'll know why theme is double-quoted once you try out the
site on =hugo=.

Check out the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content-org/all-posts.org][example single Org file]]. That is created for testing various
Org->Hugo content and meta-data translation features. [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site/content/posts][Here]] are the
exported Markdown files.
**** How to try =ox-hugo= on that site?
1. Clone this repo:
   #+begin_example
   git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo
   #+end_example
2. Ensure that ~pandoc~ and ~pandoc-citeproc~ (at least version
   {{{pandoc_version}}}) are installed (more info
   {{{doc(contributing-guide,#contribute-to-code,here)}}}).
3. Start the =hugo= server:
   #+begin_example
   make serve HUGO_BASE_DIR=test/site
   #+end_example
4. Open =http://localhost:1337= in your browser.
5. In a different terminal, =cd= to the repo directory.
6. Run:
   #+begin_example
   make md
   #+end_example
7. In few seconds, hundreds of test posts will get created, with the
   =hugo server= aided preview in the browser zapping through each new
   created post.
**** Alternative way
1. Clone this repo.
   #+begin_example
   git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo
   #+end_example
2. Ensure that ~pandoc~ and ~pandoc-citeproc~ (at least version
   {{{pandoc_version}}}) are installed (more info
   {{{doc(contributing-guide,#contribute-to-code,here)}}}).
3. =cd= to the =test/site/= directory and do:
   #+begin_example
   hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
   #+end_example
4. Above command will mention the localhost where the site is
   served. Open that in your browser.
5. In emacs, =(require  'ox-hugo)= or evaluate the =ox-hugo.el= from the
   cloned repo.
6. Open the {{{ox-hugo-test-file}}} file.
7. =C-c C-e H A= -- That will export *all* subtrees in the file to
   Markdown files.
8. In few seconds, hundreds of test posts will get created, with the
   =hugo server= aided preview in the browser zapping through each new
   created post.

**** For subtree-based exports
When organizing the posts as Org *subtrees*, many Hugo front-matter
variables get set implicitly using the meta-data parsed from the posts
in Org.

Below, where /subtree/ is mentioned, it implies a *valid Hugo-post
subtree* i.e. an Org subtree that has the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property
set.

*** Dates
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: dates
:END:
**** Defcustoms
***** =org-hugo-date-format=
- Default value :: ="%Y-%m-%dT%T%z"=

This variable sets the date format used for exporting /date/
front-matter parameters like =date=, =publishDate=, =expiryDate=,
=lastmod=.

Note that the date format *must match* the date specification from
[[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8][RFC3339]].

Examples of RFC3339-compatible values for this variable:

|---------------------------+-----------------------------|
| Value                     | Example output              |
|---------------------------+-----------------------------|
| =%Y-%m-%dT%T%z= (default) | =2017-07-31T17:05:38-04:00= |
| =%Y-%m-%dT%T=             | =2017-07-31T17:05:38=       |
| =%Y-%m-%d=                | =2017-07-31=                |
|---------------------------+-----------------------------|

Do =C-h v org-hugo-date-format= for more information (within Emacs,
once the =ox-hugo= package is loaded).

***** =org-hugo-suppress-lastmod-period=
 - Default value :: =0.0=

A suppressing period (in seconds) during which the =lastmod= parameter
is not added to the front matter. The suppressing period is counted as
a delta between the =date= and =lastmod= parameters.

If the value is 86400.0, the =lastmod= parameter will not be added to the
front matter within 24 hours from the value of =date= parameter.

=lastmod= would be exported when you initially change the Org TODO
state to =DONE= by saving the file automatically with the following
conditions. Some users may not prefer this behavior.

| Variable                         | Value |
|----------------------------------+-------|
| org-hugo-auto-set-lastmod        | t     |
| org-hugo-auto-export-on-save     | t     |
| org-log-done                     | time  |

In such case, you can suppress =lastmod= in the front-matter if you set
=org-hugo-suppress-lastmod-period= to =60.0= or other appropriate value.

Note that this variable is effective only if auto-setting of the
=lastmod= parameter is enabled i.e. if =org-hugo-auto-set-lastmod= or
=EXPORT_HUGO_AUTO_SET_LASTMOD= is non-nil.

**** File-based Exports
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dates-file-based-exports
:END:
In Org files meant for file-based exports, you simply set a value for
a =#+hugo_FOO= keyword (in most cases, for example =#+date= is one of
the exceptions) to set the =FOO= parameter in the exported
front-matter.

**** Subtree-based Exports
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dates-subtree-based-exports
:END:
The date meta-data can be set as Org properties in post subtrees,
similar to the keywords set for [[#dates-file-based-exports][File-based exports]]. But subtree-based
exports allow an even concise way to set those dates.
***** Date
This is interpreted from the Org [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-properties.html][Special Property]] =CLOSED=.

The =CLOSED= property is inserted once the post-subtree's =TODO= state
is set to =DONE= (~C-c C-t~), *if* the =org-log-done= variable is set
to ='time= (default is /nil/). This option can also be enabled on a
per-file-basis with =#+startup: logdone=.

Here's an example:
#+begin_src org
,* DONE My post
CLOSED: [2018-01-23 Tue 14:10]
Post content.
#+end_src

Above gets translated to =date = 2018-01-23T14:10:00-05:00= in
front-matter (TOML).

- NOTE :: Another variable =org-log-done-with-time= can be set to /nil/
          (default to =t=) if you would like the =CLOSED= time stamp
          to contain only the date, and not the time.

/You do not then need to explicitly set the =:EXPORT_DATE:= property./
***** Publish Date
This is interpreted from the Org Special Property =SCHEDULED=. The
idea is that you schedule a task for a /future/ date, just as you
would set a post to be published in /future/. This property is
set using the default ~C-c C-s~ binding in Org.

Here's an example:
#+begin_src org
,* My future post
SCHEDULED: <2060-01-26 Mon>
Post content.
#+end_src

Above gets translated to =publishDate = 2060-01-26T00:00:00-05:00= in
front-matter (TOML).

/You do not then need to explicitly set the =:EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE:=
property./
***** Expiry Date
This is interpreted from the Org Special Property =DEADLINE=. The idea
is that just as you /ideally/ don't plan to work on a task after a set
deadline, you don't plan to keep a post published after a set expiry
date. This property is set using the default ~C-c C-d~ binding in Org.

Here's an example:
#+begin_src org
,* My short-lived post
DEADLINE: <2018-02-06 Tue>
Post content.
#+end_src

Above gets translated to =expiryDate = 2018-02-06T00:00:00-05:00= in
front-matter (TOML).

/You do not then need to explicitly set the =:EXPORT_HUGO_EXPIRYDATE:=
property./
***** Last modified
Like any other front-matter property, you can explicitly set the /last
modified/ date too, using the =:EXPORT_HUGO_LASTMOD:= property.

But what's the point of calling a property /last modified/, if you
forget to manually update that property *each time* you update the
post. SO =ox-hugo= takes care of that for you.. if you set the property
=:EXPORT_HUGO_AUTO_SET_LASTMOD:= to a non-nil value.

It's normal for one to choose to auto-set the /last modified/ date for
all the posts. So instead of setting the above property for each post
individually, it might be more convenient to simply put
=#+hugo_auto_set_lastmod: t= at the top of the file.
*** Image Links
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: image-links
:END:
This section will provides few alternatives for linking to images in
Org files in a way that's compatible with =ox-hugo= and Hugo.

For the sake of the below explanation, let's have the /HUGO_BASE_DIR/
(the directory containing the Hugo site's =config.toml= file) be
=~/hugo/=.

In that case, the Hugo /static/ directory will be =~/hugo/static/=.
**** References to files in the /static/ directory
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: references-to-files-in-the-static-directory
:END:
Now if you have a file =~/hugo/static/images/foo.png=, =ox-hugo= makes
it convenient for you to reference that image by simply
=/images/foo.png=. Note that this is *not* the default behavior of
other Org exporters.

But in the case of Hugo, as the referenced file will /normally/ be in
the Hugo /static/ directory, =ox-hugo= allows the =/images/foo.png=
style of short reference *if* that is a valid path under that Hugo
site's /static/ directory.

See the below examples on how to reference images in different ways:
***** Inline image (Unhyperlinked)
#+begin_src org
[[/images/foo.png]]
#+end_src
***** Inline image (Hyperlinked to the image itself)
#+begin_src org
[[file:/images/foo.png][file:/images/foo.png]]
#+end_src
- NOTE :: The =file:= prefix *has to be used* in both Link and
          Description components of the Org link.
***** Link to an image (Image not inlined)
#+begin_src org
[[/images/foo.png][Click here to see foo.png]]
#+end_src
This style of linking will work for references to non-image files in
the /static/ directory too.
**** References to files *outside* the /static/ directory
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: references-to-files-outside-the-static-directory
:END:
This is a unique feature of =ox-hugo=.

(i) If a reference is made to a file outside the Hugo /static/
directory *and* (ii) if it has one of the extensions listed in
=org-hugo-external-file-extensions-allowed-for-copying=, then that
file is copied by =ox-hugo= to the /static/ directory.

Here is an example link:
#+begin_src org
[[~/some-dir/static/images/foo.png]]
#+end_src
***** Source path contains =/static/=
If you link to files outside of the Hugo =static= directory, just
ensure that the path contains the string =/static/= /if you like to
preserve the directory structure/. Necessary directories are then
created inside the /static/ directory to preserve the structure.

Example translations between outside =static= directory paths to the
copied location inside =static=:

#+caption: Where files get copied to if their path contains =static/=
#+attr_html: :class sane-table
|----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File location outside =static=   | Copied-to location inside =static=        | Explanation                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =~/temp/static/images/foo.png=   | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/images/foo.png=   | If the *outside* path has =/static/= in it, the directory structure after that is preserved when copied. |
| =~/temp/static/img/foo.png=      | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/img/foo.png=      | (same as above)                                                                                          |
| =~/temp/static/foo.png=          | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/foo.png=          | (same as above)                                                                                          |
| =~/temp/static/articles/zoo.pdf= | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/articles/zoo.pdf= | (same as above)                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

See the {{{doc(usage,#before-you-export,Usage → Before you export)}}}
section to learn how to set the *HUGO_BASE_DIR*.
***** Source path does not contain =/static/=
Here is an example link where the source path does not contain
=/static/=:
#+begin_src org
[[~/some-dir/bar/foo.png]]
#+end_src

In this case, that file is copied directly to the
=org-hugo-default-static-subdirectory-for-externals= sub-directory
(=ox-hugo/= by default) within the Hugo static directory. No directory
structure generation happens in this case.

#+caption: Where files get copied to if their path *does not* contain =static/=
#+attr_html: :class sane-table
|--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File location outside =static= | Copied-to location inside =static=       | Explanation                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =~/temp/bar/baz/foo.png=       | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/ox-hugo/foo.png= | Here, as the *outside* path does not have =/static/= in it, the file is copied to the =ox-hugo/= dir in Hugo =static/= dir. |
|--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
***** Disable auto-copying
This auto-copying behavior can be disabled completely by setting
=org-hugo-external-file-extensions-allowed-for-copying= to /nil/.. but
you might not want that if you keep your files *outside* the Hugo
static directory.
*** Source blocks
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: source-blocks
:END:
=ox-hugo= tries to generate Markdown with fenced code blocks if
possible. It also supports exporting source blocks with line numbers
and/or highlighting enabled for specific lines.
**** Code Fences
By default, the =HUGO_CODE_FENCE= property is set to a non-nil
value. So the code blocks will be exported with GitHub-style
code-fencing with triple-backticks when possible.

Example:

#+begin_src md
```emacs-lisp
(message "Hello")
```
#+end_src

- Note :: It is necessary to set the Hugo site config variable
          =pygmentsCodeFences= to =true= for syntax highlighting to
          work for fenced code blocks.

The Hugo =highlight= shortcode is automatically used instead of code
fences (even with this property at a non-nil value) if:
- Line numbers are enabled using the Org =-n= / =+n= syntax (see
  below), or
- Line highlighting is enabled using the =:hl_lines= parameter in the
  source block header (see below).

Set the =HUGO_CODE_FENCE= property to =nil= if you want to *always*
use the Hugo =highlight= shortcode.
**** Line numbers
Line numbers can be enabled/configured using the Org =-n= / =+n=
syntax. See the Info node [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-examples.html][=(org) Literal examples=]] for more
information.

Here are some examples fetched from the "Source blocks with line
number annotation" test case in the {{{ox-hugo-test-file}}}.

#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::#source-block-line-number-cases" :only-contents t
**** Highlighting
Implementing this feature was interesting, because while Org doesn't
have a syntax to enable highlighting only specific lines, the Hugo
=highlight= shortcode does allow that via =hl_lines= argument.

So the challenge was to present that "lines to be highlighted"
information in the Org source in a nice format and then translate that
to the =hl_lines= =highlight= shortcode argument at the time of
exporting.

It involved /hacking/ the =org-babel-exp-code=. See [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2017-10/msg00300.html][this discussion on
the =emacs-orgmode= thread]] if interested.

This feature is implemented by using a parameter called =:hl_lines= in
the header of source blocks. This parameter is specific to =ox-hugo=,
and that's why implementing this needed that hack.

If a user wants to highlight lines 1, and then 3 to 5, they would add
=:hl_lines 1,3-5= to the source block header.
# Below 2 include statements fetch the noweb references used in the
# code inserted by the following include statements.

***** Without line numbers
#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::#source-blocks-with-highlighting-no-linenums" :only-contents t
***** With line numbers
The Org source for the below is similar to the above, except that the
=-n= switch is also added to enable the line numbers.

#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::#source-blocks-with-highlighting-with-linenums-not-starting-from-1" :only-contents t
*** Equations
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: equations
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :mathjax true
:END:
**** Inline equations
- Inline equations are wrapped between =\(= and =\)=.
  - =$= wrapping also works, but it is not preferred as it comes with
    restrictions like "there should be no whitespace between the
    equation and the =$= delimiters".

    So =$ a=b $= will not work (it will look like: $ a=b $), but
    =$a=b$= will work (it will look like: $a=b$).

    On the other hand, both =\(a=b\)= (it will look like: \(a=b\)) and
    =\( a=b \)= (it will look like: \( a=b \)) will work.
- One-per-line equations are wrapped between =\[= and =\]= or =$$=
  delimiters.

For example, below in Org:
#+begin_src org
LaTeX formatted equation: \( E = -J \sum_{i=1}^N s_i s_{i+1} \)
#+end_src

will look like this in Hugo rendered HTML:

LaTeX formatted equation: \( E = -J \sum_{i=1}^N s_i s_{i+1 }\)

*Don't see this in Markdown, see what it looks after Hugo has
processed it.* --- =ox-hugo= does some heavy escaping to get around a
Blackfriday issue with supporting MathJax syntax equations (that Org
supports).

Here's another example, taken from [[https://orgmode.org/manual/LaTeX-fragments.html][(org) LaTeX fragments]].

Below in Org:
#+begin_example
If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be either
$$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \]
#+end_example

renders to:

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be either
$$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \]

(Note that the last two equations show up on their own lines.)
**** {{{latex}}} Environments
=ox-hugo= support {{{latex}}} environments.

So below in Org buffer:

#+begin_src org
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
C = W\log_{2} (1+\mathrm{SNR})
\end{equation}
#+end_src

will export as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
C = W\log_{2} (1+\mathrm{SNR})
\end{equation}

Equation referencing will also work[fn:3]. So =\ref{eq:1}= will render as
\ref{eq:1}.
**** Examples
You can find many examples by looking at {{{testtag(equations)}}}.
*** Tags and Categories
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: tags-and-categories
:END:
**** Subtree-based Export
***** Tags
For subtree-based exports, the Hugo front-matter =tags= values are
derived from Org tags set for the post subtree headline.

Example:
#+begin_src org
,* My post                                                         :tag1:tag2:
#+end_src

By default, Org tags from parent headlines, and the tags set in the
=#+filetags= keyword get inherited (as the default value of
=org-use-tag-inheritance= is =t=). If the tag inheritance doesn't work
as expected, check that the value of that variable is set as required.

If the =EXPORT_HUGO_TAGS= property is set for a valid Hugo post
subtree, the value of that property will *completely override* the Org
tags set even on that subtree, the inherited values of Org-style tags
from parent headlines and even =#+filetags=.
****** Marking files to not be exported
Note that if you want to prevent a file from getting exported, you can
assign a special tag to the whole file (example: =no_no_dont_export=).
- For /per-subtree/ flow, that /don't export/ tag *has to be set using
  the =#+filetags= keyword*[fn:2].
- For /per-file/ flow, that same /dont' export/ tag *has to be set
  using the =#+hugo_tags= keyword* (because ~#+filetags~ keyword does
  not work for /per-file/ flow. See [[* File-based Export]]).

Then in your export setup, add that special tag to the
=org-export-exclude-tags= variable. You can grep through this repo for
the special tag =dont_export_during_make_test= that is used to mark
few Org files to not be exported when running the
{{{doc(test,,tests)}}}.
****** Why use =#+filetags= and not =#+tags=?
- About =#+filetags= -- [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tag-inheritance.html][Tag Inheritance]] or =C-h i g (org) Tag
  inheritance=
- About =#+tags= -- [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Setting-tags.html][Setting Tags]] or =C-h i g (org) Setting tags=
***** Categories
For subtree-based exports, the Hugo front-matter =categories= values
are derived from Org tags set for the post subtree headline, but only
the ones prefixed with *@*.

Example:
#+begin_src org
,* My post                                                       :@cat1:@cat2:
#+end_src

As with the tags, by default, the categories (Org tags with "@"
prefix) from parent headlines, and the ones set in the =#+filetags=
keyword too get inherited (as the default value of
=org-use-tag-inheritance= is =t=). If the tag inheritance doesn't work
as expected, check that the value of that variable is set as required.

If the =EXPORT_HUGO_CATEGORIES= property is set for a valid Hugo post
subtree, the value of that property will *completely override* the
categories set even on that subtree, the inherited values of
categories from parent headlines and even =#+filetags=.
**** File-based Export
The tag (and category) inheritance does not apply to the file-based
export flow. So =#+filetags= will have no effect in this flow.

- To set tags, use =#+hugo_tags=.
- To set categories, use =#+hugo_categories=.

#+begin_note
=#+filetags= will have no effect in *file-based* export flow.
#+end_note
**** Hyphens and Spaces in Org tags (and categories)
Hyphens and spaces are not allowed in Org tags (=* Heading :TAG:=).

So =ox-hugo= converts:
- *single underscores* to hyphens if =org-hugo-prefer-hyphen-in-tags=
  is set to non-nil (default).
- *double underscores* to spaces if =org-hugo-allow-spaces-in-tags= is
  set to non-nil (default).

So an Org tag *abc_def* will be exported as /tag/ *"abc-def"*, and
*abc__def* will be exported as /tag/ *"abc def"*.

The same applies to Org tags with prefix =@= which will be exported as
/categories/. So *@abc_def* will be exported as /category/
*"abc-def"*, and *@abc__def* as /category/ *"abc def"*.

To export a tag or category with an underscore, use 3 consecutive
underscores. So an Org tag *abc___def* will be exported as /tag/
*"abc_def"* (and the same for categories). If you rather prefer to
always export /single underscores/ as underscores, set
=org-hugo-prefer-hyphen-in-tags= to nil.

- NOTE :: These two variables *also affect* the tags set via
          =#+filetags= keyword (which is used only in subtree-based
          exported Org files).

These variables do not affect the tags set via keywords =#+hugo_tags=,
=#+hugo_categories= or =#+keywords= (or their respective subtree
property forms), because Org keywords and properties allow using the
hyphen and space (/in "double-quoted strings"/) characters. So the
underscores in these keywords remain untransformed on export.
**** Examples
- [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content-org/tags-and-categories.org][Org source]]
- Exported Markdown -- [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content/posts/inheriting-tags.md][=inheriting-tags.md=]], [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content/posts/overriding-tags.md][=overriding-tags.md=]]
- Hugo-generated HTML -- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/posts/inheriting-tags/][Inheriting tags]], [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/posts/overriding-tags/][Overriding tags]]
*** Table of Contents
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: org-toc
:END:
Hugo can automatically parse the Markdown content and auto-create a
Table of Contents. See its documentation on [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/][Table of Contents]]. So
=ox-hugo= does not generate the TOC using Org by default.

The only advantage of using Hugo-generated TOC is that it does not
clutter the Markdown source.

Though, the advantage of Org-generated TOC is that you get finer
control on:
- *Where* to include the TOC --- Location of the =#+toc= keyword in the
  Org content.
- How many headlines to include in the TOC --- /Example: =#+toc:
  headlines 2=/ or =:EXPORT_OPTIONS: toc:2=.
- Whether you want *all* the headlines in the TOC to be numbered or
  not --- See =org-hugo-export-with-section-numbers=.
- Whether you want *only some* headlines numbered (both in post body
  and the TOC) --- Set the =UNNUMBERED= property of that headline to
  =t=.
- Whether you want to list the sub-headings *only from the current
  heading in the post* --- /Example: ~#+toc: headlines 1 local~/.

If you want to use the Org-generated TOC instead of the Hugo-generated
one, do one of the following:
1. As the default is to use the Hugo-generated TOC, the Org-generated
   TOC has to be enabled explicitly. To do this for all your ~ox-hugo~
   generated posts, set the =org-hugo-export-with-toc= variable to a
   non-nil value like =t= or =2=.
2. Org-generated TOC can be enabled per-post by either setting the
   =EXPORT_OPTIONS= subtree property (for subtree-based exports) or
   the =OPTIONS= keyword (for file-based exports) to a non-nil value,
   like ~toc:t~ or ~toc:2~.
3. Above two options will insert the TOC between the front-matter and
   the Markdown content. If you'd like to insert the Org-generated TOC
   anywhere else in the post, you can do it using the =#+toc=
   keyword.. Example: =#+toc: headlines 2=.

See the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Table-of-contents.html][Table of Contents]] section in the Org manual for more info.

/Note that =ox-hugo= does not support =#+toc: listings= and =#+toc:
tables=./
**** "Table of Contents" heading
The "Table of Contents" heading is inserted as a plain HTML ~div~
element. Users can customize the looks of that ~div~ by setting CSS
rules for ~.ox-hugo-toc .heading~.

Here is an example CSS rule for that:
#+begin_src css
.ox-hugo-toc .heading {
    font-size: 1.8em;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-align: center;
}
#+end_src
**** Excluding Org-generated TOC from Hugo summaries
As mentioned above, if you use Hugo-generated TOC, the advantage is
that the TOC is not inserted physically in the content Markdown
file.

But with the Org-generated TOC, it *will* be. The disadvantage of that
is that the =.Summary= in Hugo will consider the TOC! So your TOC will
show up in places you don't expect.. like summaries in post lists, in
twitter cards, etc.

But.. there's a way to fix that, because =ox-hugo= inserts a special
comment ~<!--endtoc-->~ at the end of the inserted TOC.

Using that special comment, this [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/summary_minus_toc.html][=summary_minus_toc.html=]] partial
tries to get the "summary you mean". This partial is used by the
=ox-hugo= test site.
- You can find examples of where this partial can be used in
  [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/opengraph.html][=opengraph.html=]] and  [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/twitter_cards.html][=twitter_cards.html=]] partials, also used in
  the test site.

/Note that you would need to use the =summary_minus_toc.html= partial
wherever you do not intend to have TOC included in the summary (for
example, in the Opengraph =og:description= meta tag)./
*** Table Styling
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: table-styling
:END:
Classic =ox-html= allows setting table attributes directly using
=#+attr_html=. But specifying the attributes directly in the =<table>=
tag is [[https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html-markup-20110113/table.html#table-constraints][admonished in HTML5]] .. /and so Hugo/Blackfriday do not allow
any way to directly insert attributes *inside* the =<table>= tag./

So a workaround is used by =ox-hugo=.. it wraps the tables with =<div>=
tags with classes, which a user can then use to style the tables using
CSS.. /just as recommended by HTML5/ :smile:.

=ox-hugo= can style different tables in different ways on the same
page, with the help of =#+attr_html= and =#+attr_css= (*introduced in
=ox-hugo=*) attributes.

1. =#+attr_html= is used to assign one or more classes to a table.
   #+begin_src org
   ,#+attr_html: :class sane-table
   #+end_src
   - Wraps the table in =<div>= tags with =sane-table= class.
   - Sets style from =#+attr_css=, if present, for =.sane-table table=
     scope.

   or

   #+begin_src org
   ,#+attr_html: :class zebra-striping sane-table
   #+end_src
   - Wraps the table in =<div>= tags with =zebra-striping= *and*
     =sane-table= classes.
   - Sets style from =#+attr_css=, if present, *only* for the
     =.zebra-striping table= scope i.e. only for the first class
     listed in that attribute. Specifying multiple classes to a table
     is useful if you want that table to inherit the styling from CSS
     rules for multiple classes.
2. =#+attr_css= is used to assign the specified styles to the
   class of the table it precedes.

   Examples:
   #+begin_src org
   ,#+attr_css: :width 80%
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src org
   ,#+attr_css: :text-align left
   #+end_src

   - If =#+attr_html= is used to specify the table class, the style is
     applied to the first of the list of classes (as explained above).
   - If =#+attr_html= is *not* used to set a custom class name for the
     table, the class name is auto-derived..
     - If the table =#+caption= is present, the class name is
       =table-N= where "N" is the /Nth/ captioned table on that page.
     - If the table is not captioned, the class name is always
       =table-nocaption=. So.. if you want to have different styling
       for different tables, make sure that you either set their
       custom class name using =#+attr_html=, or caption them.


- All tables exported with the =<div>= tags have the class
  =ox-hugo-table=. This can be useful if you want to set a common
  style for all those tables.
- =#+attr_css= applies styling only to the =.CLASS table= scope. So if
  you want more styling i.e. for other elements like =td=, =tr=, etc,
  you would need to do that in an =#+export_begin html= block.

  Example:

  #+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_export html
  <style>
  .my-table th,
  .my-table td {
      padding: 20px;
      text-align: left;
  }
  </style>
  ,#+end_export
  ,#+caption: Table with verbatim CSS
  ,#+attr_html: :class my-table
  | h1  | h2  | h3  |
  |-----+-----+-----|
  | abc | def | ghi |
  #+end_src

You can find many examples of table styling here:

#+attr_html: :class sane-table

*** Details and summary
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: details-and-summary
:END:
The "details" Org Special Block (~#+begin_details~ .. ~#+end_details~)
is used for generating the Details disclosure elements [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details][~<details>~]]
and ~<summary>~.

The summaries nested in these "details" Org Special blocks are created
using the "summary" Org Special block ~#+begin_summary~
.. ~#+end_summary~.
**** Regular details disclosure
#+begin_src org
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Why is this in *green*?
#+end_summary
You will learn that later below in [[#details-css][CSS]] section.
#+end_details
#+end_src
will render like below:
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Why is this in *green*?
#+end_summary
You will learn that later below in [[#details-css][CSS]] section.
#+end_details
**** Details disclosure without details or without summary
- If the ~details~ Special Block does not contain the ~summary~
  Special Block, a details-only disclosure will be created.
  #+begin_src org
  #+begin_details
  Here are the /details/.
  #+end_details
  #+end_src
  will render like below:
  #+begin_details
  Here are the /details/.
  #+end_details
  #+begin_note
  In the absence of summary, most browsers will use a default string
  "Details" for the summary.
  #+end_note
- If the ~details~ Special Block contains *only* the ~summary~ Special
  Block, a summary-only disclosure will be created.
  #+begin_src org
  #+begin_details
  #+begin_summary
  Some *Summary*
  #+end_summary
  #+end_details
  #+end_src
  will render like below:
  #+begin_details
  #+begin_summary
  Some *Summary*
  #+end_summary
  #+end_details
  #+begin_note
  Even if the details part is absent, the collapsing triangle will
  still be rendered. But nothing will show up when that triangle is
  uncollapsed.. /as the details portion is not there/.
  #+end_note
**** Open by default disclosure widget
The ~<details>~ disclosure widget is initially closed by default. But
it can be made to show up opened by default by adding the ~:open t~
attribute like this:
#+begin_src org
#+attr_html: :open t
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Some *Summary*
#+end_summary
Here are the /details/.
#+end_details
#+end_src
will render like below:
#+attr_html: :open t
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Some *Summary*
#+end_summary
Here are the /details/.
#+end_details
#+begin_note
For open-by-default disclosure widgets, the ~#+attr_html~ keyword
specifically needs to contain ~:open t~.
#+end_note
**** CSS rules for these widgets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: details-css
:END:
- ~details summary~ will apply to the /summary/ portion of the
  disclosure widget.
- ~details .details~ will apply to the /details/ portion of the
  disclosure widget.

#+html: <style>.green { color: green; }</style>
#+html: <style>.blue { color: blue; }</style>

For instance, the CSS rules set using below caused all the disclosure
/summaries/ to show in <span class="green">green</span>, and all the
disclosure /details/ to show in <span class=blue>blue</span>.
#+begin_src org
#+html: <style>details summary { color: green; }</style>
#+html: <style>details .details { color: blue; }</style>
#+end_src

#+html: <style>details summary { color: green; }</style>
#+html: <style>details .details { color: blue; }</style>
*** Author
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: author
:END:
The ~author~ front-matter parameter is designed to always be a list or
an array, so that multiple authors can be supported.
**** Default Author
The ~author~ parameter is set to always export by default (as the
default value of ~org-export-with-author~ is ~t~).

The author name defaults to ~user-full-name~. You can choose to either
customize this variable in your Emacs config, or manually set the
author name by adding the below to the top of your Org file:
#+begin_src org
,#+author: FirstName LastName
#+end_src

If using /per-subtree/ flow, and if you want to specify the author (or
override the value set by the above ~#+author~ keyword) differently
for all posts under a subtree, add below in that subtree's property
drawer:
#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_AUTHOR: Firstname LastName
:END:
#+end_src

Either of above two author-setting methods will export to this TOML
front-matter:
#+begin_src toml
author = ["FirstName LastName"]
#+end_src
**** Multiple Authors
Multiple authors can be specified by either:
- Using multiple ~#+author~ keywords, or
  #+begin_src org
  ,#+author: FAuthor1 LAuthor1
  ,#+author: FAuthor2 LAuthor2
  #+end_src
- Specifying comma-separated authors, if setting them in subtree
  properties.
  #+begin_src org
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_AUTHOR: FAuthor1 LAuthor1, FAuthor2 LAuthor2
  :END:
  #+end_src

Either of above two author-setting methods will export to this TOML
front-matter:
#+begin_src toml
author = ["FAuthor1 LAuthor1", "FAuthor2 LAuthor2"]
#+end_src
**** Disabling exporting of ~author~ parameter
Author exporting can be disabled using any of these ways:
- To disable author exporting only for a specific Org file, add below
  to the top of that file:
  #+begin_src org
  ,#+options: author:nil
  #+end_src
- If using /per-subtree/ flow, and if you want to disable author
  exporting only for posts under specific subtrees, add below in the
  property drawers of those:
  #+begin_src org
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_OPTIONS: author:nil
  :END:
  #+end_src
- To disable author exporting by default for all exporters (not just
  ~ox-hugo~), set ~org-export-with-author~ to ~nil~ in your Emacs
  config.
**** Tweaking your Hugo template to support /list/ ~author~
#+begin_note
The ~author~ front-matter parameter is *always* exported as a
TOML/YAML list.
#+end_note
If you already have Hugo posts with the ~author~ front-matter already
set, it is possible that those values exist as single string values
instead of lists.

If so, you can use a snippet like the [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-onyx-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/author.html][~author.html~ partial]] used by
this doc site to parse the ~author~ parameter correctly (whether it's
a plain string or a list of strings).
***** Forcing ~author~ to be a /string/ (alternative)
If you are not comfortable with Hugo templates, you can alternatively
force the ~author~ param to be a plain /string/ instead of a /list/,
by setting it as a /custom/ front-matter parameter:
#+begin_src org
#+author:
#+hugo_custom_front_matter: :author "FirstName LastName"
#+end_src

- Note :: Remember to set the default author name to nil if doing this,
          by setting the ~#+author~ keyword (or ~:EXPORT_AUTHOR:~
          property) to /nothing/.
*** Hugo Summary Splitter
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: hugo-summary-splitter
:END:
#+begin_description
Manual splitting of Hugo summary.
#+end_description
In Hugo, the point of split between the summary and main content can
be specified using the ~<!--more-->~ HTML snippet. See [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/#manual-summary-splitting][its
documentation]] for more information.

The recommended way to do that in the Org files you export using
~ox-hugo~ is to use ~#+hugo: more~.

Here's an example:
#+begin_src org
My post summary.
,#+hugo: more
My post content.
#+end_src
** Enhancements
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU: :menu "6.enhancements"
:END:
*** Auto-export on Saving
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: auto-export-on-saving
:END:
Wouldn't it be awesome if you can see the live-preview of your
Hugo-rendered post each time you saved your post in Org?

Well.. you can do that with these steps, which apply to both
/per-subtree/ and /per-file/ flows:
**** First time setup
***** Step {{{n}}}: Require =ox-hugo-auto-export= package
This package is part of the =ox-hugo= package installation. It
implements the auto-exporting behavior on file saves. Among many other
things, this package declares the buffer-local variable
=org-hugo-auto-export-on-save= which is used to enable/disable the
auto-exporting.

So with =ox-hugo= installed, add this to your Emacs config:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-hugo-auto-export)
#+end_src

or if using =use-package=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-hugo-auto-export)
#+end_src
***** Step {{{n}}}: Set =org-hugo-auto-export-on-save=
This variable is /nil/ by default, so that the auto-exporting feature
can be enabled separately at project level or file level.
****** Enable for the whole project
If you want to enable auto-exporting for the whole project, add this
to the ~.dir-locals.el~ file in the project root:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(("content-org/"
  . ((org-mode . ((org-hugo-auto-export-on-save . t))))))
#+end_src
Above assumes that the Org files are in the /"content-org/"/ directory
(at any nested level in there) relative to that =.dir-locals.el= file:
#+begin_example
<HUGO_BASE_DIR>
  ├── config.toml
  ├── content
  ├── content-org      <-- Org files in there
  ├── static
  ├── themes
  └── .dir-locals.el
#+end_example

If you have the Org file directly in the project root or in the same
directory as the ~.dir-locals.el~, add this in that file instead:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
((org-mode . ((org-hugo-auto-export-on-save . t))))
#+end_src

Note that with above, ~org-hugo-auto-export-on-save~ will be set to
~t~ for *all* Org files in the project. If that's what you don't want
see [[* Enable only for an Org file]].
******* Enabling for multiple projects
To enable auto-exporting for multiple projects, simply add similar
=.dir-locals.el= files to the root directories of those projects. Just
ensure that the relative Org file directories, like the
/"content-org/"/ in above example, are set correctly.
****** Enable only for an Org file
Add below to the very-end of your Org file and *save the file*:
#+begin_src org
,* Footnotes
,* COMMENT Local Variables                          :ARCHIVE:
# Local Variables:
# org-hugo-auto-export-on-save: t
# End:
#+end_src
*About Footnotes*: Here I recommend adding the =* Footnotes=
 header[fn:5] too so that in case you add any Org footnotes, they go
 directly to that section you created. Otherwise, Org will auto-create
 a new /Footnotes/ heading *at the end of the file*.. and the /Local
 Variables/ heading would then no longer be at the end of the file.
****** Enable for the whole project except for few Org files
1. Enable the auto-exporting for the whole project as explained [[* Enable for the whole project][above]].
2. Then add below to the very-end of the Org file where you need to
   disable the auto-exporting:
   #+begin_src org
   ,* Footnotes
   ,* COMMENT Local Variables                          :ARCHIVE:
   # Local Variables:
   # org-hugo-auto-export-on-save: nil
   # End:
   #+end_src
   Note that this time, =org-hugo-auto-export-on-save= is set to /nil/
   to override the /t/ value set in the =.dir-locals.el=.

#+begin_note
After updating the value of =org-hugo-auto-export-on-save= using
either of the above methods, remember to (i) save the Org file where
you expect the auto-exporting to work, and (ii) revert the buffer
(~M-x revert-buffer~). That will ensure that the updated
=org-hugo-auto-export-on-save= is effective.
#+end_note
**** Steps that /might/ need to be taken every time
Once the initial setup is done, the following steps apply to both
blogging flows.
***** Step {{{n}}}: Start the engines (Hugo Server)
We start the =hugo server= so that we can see the live-preview each
time the Org file is saved[fn:6].

Run below in your Hugo site root (the directory that contains the site
=config.toml=) to start the server:
#+begin_example
hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
#+end_example
***** Step {{{n}}}: Open your browser
By default the site is served locally on port /1313/ on
/localhost/. So the above step would have printed something like below
at the end:
#+begin_example
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
#+end_example

So open your favorite browser pointing to that address.
**** FINAL step that needs to be taken every time
***** Step {{{n}}}: Save and be in awe
If you are like me, you might not need to repeat steps 3 and 4 above,
as you can leave the =hugo= server running in a separate terminal, and
have a browser tab pinned to that localhost.

So with that, have the Emacs and browser frames set up side-by-side,
and edit your Org post.

Hit =C-x C-s= and be in awe as the browser auto-refreshes to the
*exact post you modified*!
*** Org Capture Setup
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: org-capture-setup
:END:
**** An Org Capture template
If you do not want to manually type the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= for each
new post, here is an example Org Capture template can help:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Populates only the EXPORT_FILE_NAME property in the inserted headline.
(with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
  (defun org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template ()
    "Returns `org-capture' template string for new Hugo post.
See `org-capture-templates' for more information."
    (let* ((title (read-from-minibuffer "Post Title: ")) ;Prompt to enter the post title
           (fname (org-hugo-slug title)))
      (mapconcat #'identity
                 `(
                   ,(concat "* TODO " title)
                   ":PROPERTIES:"
                   ,(concat ":EXPORT_FILE_NAME: " fname)
                   ":END:"
                   "%?\n")          ;Place the cursor here finally
                 "\n")))

  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
               '("h"                ;`org-capture' binding + h
                 "Hugo post"
                 entry
                 ;; It is assumed that below file is present in `org-directory'
                 ;; and that it has a "Blog Ideas" heading. It can even be a
                 ;; symlink pointing to the actual location of all-posts.org!
                 (file+olp "all-posts.org" "Blog Ideas")
                 (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template))))
#+end_src

Above capture will auto-insert a heading prefixed with =TODO=. With
=org-log-done= set to ='time=, on changing the =TODO= state to the
=DONE= state (=C-c C-t=), a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-properties.html][/Special Property/]] called =CLOSED= will be
auto-inserted below the heading. Below is an example.
#+begin_example
,*** DONE Narrowing the Author column in Magit                       :org:log:
CLOSED: [2017-12-18 Mon 16:36]
#+end_example
=ox-hugo= auto-sets the =date= field in the front-matter to the time
stamp in that =CLOSED= property.
**** Alternative way: Export Hugo posts to a /Page Bundle/ organization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-capture-template-page-bundle
:END:
=ox-hugo= has /first-class/ support for the [[https://scripter.co/hugo-leaf-and-branch-bundles/][Page Bundles]] style of
content organization, introduced in Hugo v0.32.

If you prefer to have the exported posts to use the Page Bundles style
of content organization, define the same
=org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template= as below:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template ()
  "Returns `org-capture' template string for new Hugo post.
See `org-capture-templates' for more information."
  (let* ((title (read-from-minibuffer "Post Title: ")) ;Prompt to enter the post title
         (fname (org-hugo-slug title)))
    (mapconcat #'identity
               `(
                 ,(concat "* TODO " title)

*** Images in Content
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: images-in-content
:END:
Conventionally any static content for a Hugo site, like images, PDF
files, and other attachments are put in the site =static/=
directory. Files in that directory are served at the site root when
the Hugo publishes that site. So all the content in there can be
accessed using the root prefix =/=. So a =static/foo.png= file can be
accessed at =/foo.png=.

More detail for this conventional approach can be found in the
documentation for
{{{doc(image-links,#references-to-files-in-the-static-directory,referencing
files in static directory)}}}.
**** But.. what about putting images along with the content?
OK, so with that short intro out of the way, =ox-hugo= supports
putting the /attachment files/ in the same directory as the source Org
files!

In the below example, the left hand side shows the Org content and
attachment file organization that the user would need to do
manually. And the right hand side shows the structure that =ox-hugo=
will generate in the =content/= and =static/= (the /conventional/ way
discussed above) directories.

#+begin_example
./content-org
├── images-in-content/
│  ├── images-in-content.org
│  │    * Post 1 (Org subtree)   →  ./content/images-in-content/post1.md
│  │    * Post 2 (Org subtree)   →  ./content/images-in-content/post2.md
│  ├── gnu.png                   →  ./static/ox-hugo/gnu.png
│  └── org.png                   →  ./static/ox-hugo/org.png
├── post3/
│  ├── post3.org                 →  ./content/images-in-content/post3.md
│  └── gnu-copy.png              →  ./static/ox-hugo/gnu-copy.png
└── post4/
   ├── post4.org                 →  ./content/images-in-content/post4.md
   └── org-copy.png              →  ./static/ox-hugo/org-copy.png
#+end_example

Have a look at the
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content-org/images-in-content/images-in-content.org][=content-org/images-in-content/images-in-content.org=]] file for an
example of how to reference same-directory files (=gnu.png= and
=org.png= in this example) in an Org file (/Hint: Just as you would do
in a normal Org file/).

The benefit of this /same-directory-attachment/ approach is that you
don't need to use any directory prefix to reference those files
(example: =[[file:gnu.png]]=). When =ox-hugo= exports those posts though,
the images are auto-copied to the =static/ox-hugo/= directory[fn:1]
and =/ox-hugo/= prefix is added to those file references in the
exported Markdown files.

Also as the image file references are valid within the Org file, you
can see those images inline too!

[[file:/images/images-in-content-screenshot.png]]
**** Examples
Whether you prefer the subtree-based approach or file-based approach
for writing your posts in Org, there are examples for both in the
=ox-hugo= test suite:
- [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site/content-org/images-in-content][Org source]]
- [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/master/test/site/content/images-in-content][Exported Markdown]]
*** Replace Front-matter Keys
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: replace-front-matter-keys
:END:
This is a =ox-hugo=-unique feature that allows you to replace any
front-matter key name to accommodate for your favorite Hugo theme.

#+hugo: more

The syntax is:

#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: oldkey1>newkey1 oldkey2>newkey2
#+end_src

or, if you want this to apply only for a specific Org tree:

#+begin_src org
:EXPORT_HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_KEY_REPLACE: oldkey1>newkey1 oldkey2>newkey2
#+end_src

Here are few use cases to better explain this feature.

- Note :: I use property drawers in the below examples (used in
          subtree-based flow). But the same would work for the Org
          keyword equivalents in file-based flow too.

**** Use =description= in Org file, but export as =summary=
The /Description/ meta-data is standard in Org and even Hugo. But some
theme may choose to have its own front-matter key called =summary=
instead of =description=.

As =summary= is not a default front-matter key in Hugo, you would need
to set it using the following property:

#+begin_src org
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :summary "Here is my post summary."
#+end_src

But if you use =description=, you can use the same in a more concise
fashion:

#+begin_src org
:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: Here is my post summary.
#+end_src

or even this in the Org body:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_description
Here is my *post summary*.

And this can be over /multiple lines/ too!
,#+end_description
#+end_src

The good news is that you can use the above concise forms (using
/description/) in your Org source, and *still export those as
=summary=*! :smile:

Simply add this at the top of your Org file:

#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: description>summary
#+end_src
**** Use Org tags, but export as =keywords=
Here's another scenario.. you painstakingly set Org tags for all your
posts, and then you switch to a theme that calls refers to your =tags=
as =keywords= instead!

Captain =HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_KEY_REPLACE= is here to help you
again! :sunglasses:

Just add this at the top of your Org file:

#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: tags>keywords
#+end_src
**** Swap =tags= and =categories=
And one more example.. you call them /tags/, the Hugo theme calls them
/categories/, and vice-versa.

What do you do? ..

#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: tags>categories categories>tags
#+end_src
**** Removing front-matter keys during export
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: removing-keys
:END:
In the front-matter key replacement syntax:
#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: oldkey>newkey
#+end_src
If ~newkey~ is a special string *nil*, ~oldkey~ will be _removed_ from
the exported front-matter.

For example, if you want to remove the ~aliases~ front-matter from
your exported files (but want to leave them in your Org files), simply
add this to the top of your Org files:
#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: aliases>nil
#+end_src
**** Examples
You can find a bunch of examples if you search for /"Replace
front-matter keys"/ in {{{ox-hugo-test-file}}}.
- Those examples are exported as {{{testtag(replace)}}}.
*** Pandoc Citations
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: pandoc-citations
:END:
The [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] Citations are prefixed with the *@* character. If the
citation is ~@foo~, that particular /foo/ reference much be present in
one of the specified bibliography files.

#+begin_note
Users need to have the ~pandoc~ and ~pandoc-citeproc~ binaries[fn:7] present
in the ~PATH~.
#+end_note

When one or more citations are found by Pandoc, a top-level
"References" section with matching references is automatically added
at the very end of the post.
**** Enabling
Pandoc based citation parsing is enabled by setting the
~#+hugo_pandoc_citations:~ keyword or ~:EXPORT_HUGO_PANDOC_CITATIONS:~
subtree property to ~t~.

#+begin_note
If a post has neither [[* Nocite][~nocite~]] meta-data, nor valid citation keys
(~@foo~), the Pandoc parsing step is skipped *even if* the above
Pandoc Citations parsing option is enabled.
#+end_note
**** Bibliography
Bibliography files (~example.bib~) are specified using the
~#+bibliography:~ keyword or ~:EXPORT_BIBLIOGRAPHY:~ subtree
property. *It is mandatory to specify at least one bibliography file.*

Multiple comma-separated bibliography files can be
specified.

/Note that the path to these bibliography files is relative to the Org
file directory./
**** Nocite
~nocite~ is a special Pandoc-specific meta-data which can be used to
add extra citations even when they are not referenced in the post. It
is set like any other list-type custom front-matter parameter
(i.e. ~:LIST_PARAM '(ELEMENT1 ELEMENT2)~). See its example [[#pandoc-citations-example][below]].
**** Link citations
~link-citations~ is a special Pandoc-specific meta-data which, when
set to ~true~, enables linking of the citations in the post body to
the corresponding reference in the "References" section. It is set
like any other single-value custom front-matter parameter
(i.e. ~:LIST_PARAM VALUE~). See its example [[#pandoc-citations-example][below]].
**** Specifying Citation Style Language (CSL)
By default, Pandoc uses /Chicago Manual of Style author-date/ as the
[[https://citationstyles.org/][Citation Style Language]] ([[https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations][ref]]). This can be customized by using the
Pandoc-specific meta-data ~csl~ to specify the new CSL file. It is set
like any other single-value custom front-matter parameter
(i.e. ~:LIST_PARAM VALUE~). See its example [[#pandoc-citations-example][below]].

/Note that the path to the CSL file is relative to the Org file
directory./
**** Removal of Pandoc-specific meta-data
The Pandoc-specific meta-data mentioned above (~nocite~,
~link-citations~ and ~csl~) are auto-deleted from the front-matter in
the final Markdown file that's supposed to be used by Hugo.

Those meta-data were added using HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER *only for
Pandoc* to parse. Also there's no point leaking the user's
bibliography and CSL file paths in the front-matter to be processed by
Hugo.
**** Example
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pandoc-citations-example
:END:
Here is a mini-example using Pandoc Citations:

          to exist in the same directory containing that Org file.

{{{test-search(citations)}}}

Also see [[https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations][Pandoc Manual -- Citations]] for more details.
**** How Pandoc Citations work
1. ~ox-hugo~ first exports the Org file/subtree to a Markdown file as
   usual.
2. ~pandoc~ then expands the ~@foo~ citations in that file and
   *rewrites* the whole Markdown file from the AST parsed by it.
***** COMMENT
/Below caveat shouldn't apply now. Pandoc output seems to be pretty
much Blackfriday-compatiable now -- <2018-07-20 Fri>/

-----

/Mostly/ this would work fine.

But you might end up with issues if the /Blackfriday/ workarounds
implemented in ~ox-hugo~ exports get removed during the rewrite by
Pandoc.

To check if an issue you see is specific to Pandoc rewrites,
- temporarily set the ~HUGO_PANDOC_CITATIONS~ option to ~nil~,
- re-export using ~ox-hugo~, and
- check if Hugo renders the final HTML correctly after that.

If this original Markdown export is parsed fine by Hugo, open an Issue
with all the details (reproducible Org snippet, failing Markdown
output by Pandoc, etc.), and we can see if this is something that can
be fixed.

(Of course, open an issue whenever any ~ox-hugo~ export does not do
things as you expect :smile:)
*** Custom Front-matter Parameters
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: custom-front-matter
:END:
#+begin_description
Setting custom front-matter parameters which have no special meaning
to Hugo, but are used in user's themes.
#+end_description

- To set a custom front-matter parameter in a subtree, use the
  ~:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER:~ property.
- To set a custom front-matter parameter globally or for /per-file/
  export flow, use the keyword ~#+hugo_custom_front_matter:~.

For the rest of this section, the /property/ method for setting the
custom front-matter will be used. But the same applies to the
/keyword/ method too (except for property-specific
~:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER+:~ syntax -- See ~(org) Property
Syntax~ for more).
**** Single value parameters
***** Syntax
#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :key1 value1 :key2 value2
:END:
#+end_src

Instead of appending all the key/value pairs on the same line, they
can instead be broken down as shown below, by appending ~+~ to the
property name.

#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :key1 value1
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER+: :key2 value2
:END:
#+end_src

If using the /keyword/ method instead, the same would be written as:
#+begin_src org
,#+hugo_custom_front_matter: :key1 value1
,#+hugo_custom_front_matter: :key2 value2
#+end_src

/The above method of appending keywords will work for the other cases
below too./
***** Example
#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :feature true

booleans = [true, false]
#+end_src
**** Maps of single and list values
Maps of keys with single or list values are supported.

#+begin_note
/Maps of maps/ or /TOML tables of tables/ are not supported. See [[*

  floats = [12.3, -5.0, -1.7e-05]
  booleans = [true, false]
#+end_src
**** Front-matter Extra
You would use this feature only if you need to use some front-matter
that ~ox-hugo~ cannot translate from native Org keywords/properties to
TOML/YAML front-matter. A good example is if you need to add custom
/map of map/ type front-matter (or TOML /tables of tables/).

The front-matter specified in this manner is appended *verbatim* to
the *end* of the ~ox-hugo~ generated front-matter.
***** TOML Extra front-matter
Create a *toml* Org source block anywhere in your post, and add the
special header args ~:front_matter_extra t~ to it.

/The TOML front-matter is the default. So you do not need to set
~:EXPORT_HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_FORMAT: toml~./
#+begin_src org
,* Post with TOML front-matter (default)
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: extra-front-matter-toml
:END:
The contents of the ~#+begin_src toml :front_matter_extra t~ TOML
block here will get appended to the TOML front-matter.
,#+begin_src toml :front_matter_extra t
[[foo]]
  bar = 1
  zoo = "abc"
[[foo]]
  bar = 2
  zoo = "def"
,#+end_src
#+end_src
***** YAML Extra front-matter
Create a *yaml* Org source block anywhere in your post, and add the
special header args ~:front_matter_extra t~ to it.

#+begin_src org
,* Post with YAML front-matter
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: extra-front-matter-yaml
:EXPORT_HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_FORMAT: yaml
:END:
The contents of the ~#+begin_src yaml :front_matter_extra t~ YAML
block here will get appended to the YAML front-matter.
,#+begin_src yaml :front_matter_extra t
foo:
  - bar: 1
    zoo: abc
  - bar: 2
    zoo: def
,#+end_src
#+end_src
***** Wrong format of extra front-matter
The ~:front_matter_extra t~ source block LANG *has* to match your
selected front-matter format.

You cannot have a ~#+begin_src yaml :front_matter_extra t~ extra
front-matter block if your front-matter format is YAML (and
vice-versa).

If that happens, that blocks gets exported neither to the Markdown
body nor to the front-matter.
**** More Examples
You can find many other examples by looking at {{{testtag(custom-fm)}}}.
*** Hugo Section
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: hugo-section
:END:
#+begin_description
Specifying the path under Hugo "content" to where the Markdown file
should be exported.
#+end_description
**** Default
By default, ~ox-hugo~ exports all the markdown files to
~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/posts/~.

The "posts" sub-directory default is set in the
~org-hugo-default-section-directory~ /defcustom/ variable which a user
can customize.

With the below Org file, the post will export to that "posts"
sub-directory:

#+begin_src org
,#+hugo_base_dir: .

,* My post
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-post
:END:
This gets created in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/posts/~.
#+end_src

Setting ~org-hugo-default-section-directory~ will affect
globally---All your ~ox-hugo~ exported projects.
**** Setting ~HUGO_SECTION~ per file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hugo-section-keyword
:END:
If you need to override the default ~HUGO_SECTION~ only in an Org
file, set the ~#+hugo_section~ keyword.
#+begin_src org
,#+hugo_base_dir: .
,#+hugo_section: articles

,* My post
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-post
:END:
This gets created in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/articles/~.
#+end_src
**** Setting ~HUGO_SECTION~ per subtree (only /per-subtree/ flow)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hugo-section-property
:END:
If you need to override *both* the default ~HUGO_SECTION~ and the Org
file specific ~#+hugo_section~ keyword, set the ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~
subtree property.
#+begin_src org
,#+hugo_base_dir: .
,#+hugo_section: articles

,* About
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: /
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: about
:END:
This gets created directly in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/~.
,* My post
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-post
:END:
This gets created in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/articles/~. As the
~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ property is not set, the ~#+hugo_section~
keyword value applies.
,* Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: notes
:END:
,** My note
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-note
:END:
This gets created in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/notes/~.
#+end_src

The ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ does not need to be set in the same subtree
as the post.

The benefit of this is that you can have a parent subtree set the
~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ value, and then have all the children subtrees
inherit that value. See the "Notes" subtree in above example to see
this inheritance in action.
**** Section path fragments (only /per-subtree/ flow)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hugo-section-fragments
:END:
The default Org Property behavior is that the value of a property set
in the /closest parent/ wins. See the below example to understand
that.

#+name: code__using_only_EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION
#+caption: Using only ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~
#+begin_src org
,* Main section
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: main
:END:
The parsed value of ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ property is ~"main"~ here.
,** Sub section 1
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: sub
:END:
The parsed value of ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ property is ~"sub"~ here. The
earlier set ~"main"~ value in the parent of this subtree is lost.

I would have liked the parent value ~"main"~ to get auto-prepended here.
,** Sub section 2
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: main/sub
:END:
The parsed value of ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ property is ~main/sub~ here.

While this works, it gets a bit inconvenient to manually prefix the
parent property value (~"main/"~ here) as the number of nesting levels
increase.
#+end_src

But this is Emacs, and with the help of Emacs-Lisp and kind help from
/Ihor Radchenko/ on the [[https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-orgmode/2018-10/msg00002.html][Org mailing list]], ~ox-hugo~ now has a solution
to this!

#+begin_verse
>    /Introducing *~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~* (with that asterisk)/ :tada:
#+end_verse

If a subtree has the ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~ property set, it is
treated as a section path *fragment*. Such fragment properties will be
concatenated with the *same* fragment properties further up in the
parent hierarchy.

The collective concatenated value of ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~ properties
is further prefixed with the value of the good old ~HUGO_SECTION~
keyword/property that's effective in that subtree.

#+begin_note
~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~ *has* to be set as a subtree property. There is
no Org keyword equivalent for this, because this property is designed
only for /per-subtree/ flow (and it makes sense only for this flow).
#+end_note

So the final *section path* looks like this:
#+begin_example
<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/<concatenated values of EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*>/
                        └─────────────────────  section path  ──────────────────────┘
#+end_example

See the below example to get further clarity on this logic.

* Footnotes

[fn:7] The Pandoc Citations feature was last <2018-08-19 Sun> tested
with Pandoc version {{{pandoc_version}}}. If you are running an older
version, the quickest way to install might be to simply download the
latest release archive from [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases][Pandoc releases]], extract it and put the
~pandoc~ and ~pandoc-citeproc~ binaries in one of the directories in
your /PATH/.

[fn:6] If you are still using a Hugo version older than 0.25, update
now! -- Because that version added support for the awesome
=--navigateToChanged= switch.

[fn:5] I am assuming that the value of ~org-footnote-section~ in your
Emacs setup is the default value ~"Footnotes"~. If it's not, change
the "Footnotes" heading in that example accordingly.

[fn:4] The ~TODO~ / ~DONE~ keyword is used in this example as they are
the defaults in ~org-todo-keywords~. If you have customized your
~org-todo-keywords~, or are customizing them using other means like
the per-file ~#+seq_todo~ setting, use those instead. Use your custom
"DONE" keyword (it should be a part of ~org-done-keywords~) instead of
the default ~DONE~. And similarly, use your custom "TODO" keyword
instead of the default ~TODO~ (ensure that it is *not* in
~org-done-keywords~).

[fn:3] This requires MathJax. [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/mathjax.html][Here]] is a MathJax configuration that is
tested to work for equation referencing (referencing =\label{}=
labeled equations using =\ref{}=). The same is used on the =ox-hugo=
test site too.

[fn:2] For only subtree-based exports, you can set that special tag as
Org style tags too. Example: ~* I don't want to export this post
:no_no_dont_export:~.. and don't forget to add that tag to
=org-export-exclude-tags= too!

[fn:1] To understand why the attachment files get copied to the
=static/ox-hugo/= directory, have a look at the documentation for
{{{doc(image-links,#references-to-files-outside-the-static-directory,referencing
files outside static directory)}}}.
