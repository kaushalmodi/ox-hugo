## The "TODO" state of this heading (which is nil) should be ignored {#the-todo-state-of-this-heading--which-is-nil--should-be-ignored}

If a post has the `DRAFT` state set, the `draft` front matter variable
should be set to `true`, even if the post has a sub-heading
immediately after the post heading.
