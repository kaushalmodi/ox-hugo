** Future Plans                                                    :noexport:
There is a plan to create a =hugo.el= that would do things like:
- New post creation using =org-capture= (port code from [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d/blob/master/setup-files/setup-hugo.el][here]]).
- Interactive functions to toggle /draft/ state,
  add/remove/increment/decrement /publishdate/ property.
- Option to use template =config.toml= and some default hugo theme. So
  all a new user would need to do is to (i) have the =hugo= [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases][binary]] in
  =PATH= (ii) define their =hugo= blog dir in the =defcustom= (iii)
  =M-x hugo=.
- Set separate faces for titles based on /draft/ state and
  /futureness/.

** Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:END:
=ox-hugo= is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to
[[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]-compatible Markdown ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]]) and also generates the
front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

The =ox-hugo= backend extends from a /parent/ backend
=ox-blackfriday.el=. The latter is the one that primarily does the
Blackfriday-friendly Markdown content generation. The main job of
=ox-hugo= is to generate the front-matter for each exported content
file, and then append that generated Markdown to it.

There are, though, few functions that =ox-hugo.el= overrides over
those by =ox-blackfriday.el=.
** Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:
This package requires at least GNU Emacs {{{min_emacs_version}}} and
Org Mode {{{min_org_version}}}. It is available on Melpa
([[https://melpa.org/#/ox-hugo]]).

Once the package is installed, you will need to /require/ it so that
the =ox-hugo= export options are available in the /Org Export
Dispatcher/ menu (the one you see when you hit =C-c C-e= to initiate
any export).

You can do that by adding the below to your config:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'ox
  (require 'ox-hugo))
#+end_src
*** Use Package
If you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][=use-package=]], you can do the below instead:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-hugo
  :ensure t            ;Auto-install the package from Melpa (optional)
  :after ox)
#+end_src

*** Spacemacs
Spacemacs users can use =ox-hugo= by setting the variable
=org-enable-hugo-support=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
              '((org :variables
                  org-enable-hugo-support t)))
#+end_src

/This was verified to work on Spacemacs =develop= branch ([[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/pull/440][ref]])./
** Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:
#+begin_note
Jump to the {{{doc(quick-start,,Quick Start)}}} section to quickly try
out ~ox-hugo~ with Hugo.
#+end_note
*** Before you export
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: before-you-export
:END:
Before you export check that these properties are set as you need:
- HUGO_BASE_DIR :: Root directory of the source for the Hugo site. If
  this is set to =~/hugo/=, the exported Markdown files will be saved
  to =~/hugo/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/= directory[fn:section_more].  By
  default, the Markdown files reside in a hierarchy under the
  =content/= directory in the site root directory ([[https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/][ref]]).

  If you try to export without setting this property, you will get
  this error:
  #+begin_example
  user-error: It is mandatory to set the HUGO_BASE_DIR property
              or the `org-hugo-base-dir' local variable
  #+end_example
  This property can be set by one of two ways:
  1. Setting the ~#+hugo_base_dir:~ keyword in the Org file.
  2. Setting the ~org-hugo-base-dir~ variable in a ~.dir-locals.el~ or
     File Local Variables.

- HUGO_SECTION :: The default Hugo section name for all the posts.
  See [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/][here]] for more information on Hugo sections.  It is common for
  this property to be set to =posts= or =blog=.  The default value is
  set using =org-hugo-default-section-directory=. See
  {{{doc(hugo-section,,Hugo Section)}}} for details.

*Important*: If you choose to export an Org subtree as a post, you
 need to set the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= subtree property. That property is
 used by this package to figure out where the current post starts. For
 that reason, *a subtree with =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property cannot nest
 another subtree with that property*. If you can analogize with the
 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)][branch/leaf data structure terminlogy]], then the subtrees with
 =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property need to be /leaf nodes/.

[fn:section_more] The ~HUGO_SECTION~ is the bare-minimum requirement
to specify the destination path. That path can be further tweaked
using ~HUGO_BUNDLE~ key (and the associated ~EXPORT_HUGO_BUNDLE~
property), and the ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~ property (only for
/per-subtree/ exports).
*** Export bindings
The common =ox-hugo= export bindings are:
**** For both one-post-per-subtree and one-post-per-file flows
- =C-c C-e H H= :: Export "What I Mean".
  - If point is in a /valid Hugo post subtree/, export that
    subtree to a Hugo post in Markdown.

    A /valid Hugo post subtree/ is an Org subtree that has the
    =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property set. *Note that a subtree with
    =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property cannot nest a subtree with the same
    property set.* If you can analogize with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)][branch/leaf data
    structure terminlogy]], then the subtrees with =EXPORT_FILE_NAME=
    property need to be /leaf nodes/.
  - If the file is intended to be exported as a whole (i.e. has the
    =#+title= keyword), export the whole Org file to a Hugo post in
    Markdown.
- =C-c C-e H A= :: Export *all* "What I Mean"
  - If the Org file has one or more 'valid Hugo post subtrees', export
    them to Hugo posts in Markdown.
  - If the file is intended to be exported as a whole (i.e. no 'valid
    Hugo post subtrees' at all, and has the =#+title= keyword), export
    the whole Org file to a Hugo post in Markdown.
**** For only the one-post-per-file flow
- =C-c C-e H h= :: Export the Org file to a Hugo post in Markdown.

/Also see the {{{doc(auto-export-on-saving,,Auto Exporting)}}} section.
*** Customization Options
Do =M-x customize-group=, and select =org-export-hugo= to see the
available customization options for this package.
**** =org-hugo-pandoc-cite-references-heading=
 - Default value :: ="References {#references}"=

This is the Markdown heading that gets inserted before the section of
references inserted by Pandoc inserted (See
{{{doc(pandoc-citations,,Pandoc Citations)}}}) at the end of the post.

To prevent the insertion of that Markdown heading, set this variable
to an empty string (=""=).

*** Editorial
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-blogging-flow-editorial
:END:
The preferred way to organize the posts is as Org subtrees (also the
main reason to write this package, as nothing like that was out there)
as it makes the meta-data management for Hugo front-matter pretty
effortless.

If you are a /one Org-file per post/ type of a person, that flow works
too! Just note that in this flow many of those =#+hugo_= properties
need to be managed manually.. just as one would manage the front-matter
in Markdown files --- See the Org versions in the above screenshots for
comparison.

The test site uses a [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme][minimal]] theme written just for debug purposes
(not extra aesthetics). The test site is designed to verify if all the
content translates from Org to Markdown as expected.

So let me show you this screenshot that took on my phone (running
Emacs in Termux app on Android), showing the single Org file that
serves as a source of this whole documentation site.

{{{imageclick(ox-hugo-doc-source-viewing-in-Termux-Android.png)}}}

-----

Using Org just as a markup like Markdown is a miniscule part of
its complete feature-set. Org also allows stuff like:
- Easy ordering/manipulation/commenting of subtrees
- Creating tables (with even formulas like in Excel)
- Directly including source code snippets from external files (instead
  of having to copy/paste them in)
- Running code snippets within the Org file and embedding the results
  (Org Babel)
- ..

Using Org for content writing allows using in-built Org features to
translate to Hugo front-matter:

- Org uses an outline structure and can inherit meta data (tags and
  properties) from one subtree to children subtrees.
- Using that feature, one can tag one tree as /emacs/, and everything
  under that tree (all posts under that) will get that tag
  automatically.
- The same concept applies to inheriting any Org /property/ meta data
  like menu entry, category, section name, etc.
- A subtree can be quickly marked to be in TODO state (default binding
  =C-c C-t=). A *TODO* post is marked as a /draft/ Hugo post.
- The /menu-item weights/, /page weights/ and /taxonomy weights/ can
  be set to be auto-calculated so that the menu items or post order in
  the final HTML appear in the same order as the respective subtrees
  in Org.

  If the subtrees are re-ordered in Org, the weights get changed too.
- One can have a subtree with section property set to "posts" and all
  post subtrees under that will go to that section. Similarly another
  parent subtree can have that property set to "articles", and so on.
- Images can be displayed inline in the Org buffer.
- After save hooks can be set up in Emacs so that each time I save the
  file, only the current subtree in Org gets exported to
  Markdown. With the Hugo server running with the
  =--navigateToChanged= switch (this allows auto-changing the preview
  to the last changed post), the flow is seamless -- Save the Org file
  and see the exact changed post in browser.
- *All* posts can simply be subtrees in a single Org file. That way
  one can take advantage of Org subtree filtering and searching
  functions (=org-sparse-tree= bound to =C-c /= by default).
- (and much more..)
*** Do I need to re-write my whole blog in Org?
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: do-I-need-to-re-write-my-whole-blog-in-org
:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU_OVERRIDE: :title "Need to re-write my blog?"
:END:
If you are considering to try out =ox-hugo=, and if you have already
been using Hugo, it is normal for this thought to cross your mind:
#+begin_quote
I already have dozens or hundreds of posts written in Markdown. Do I
need to convert them to Org if I want to start using =ox-hugo=?
#+end_quote

The answer is *No*.

This package will export your future posts written in Org to
Markdown. And those files will live along with your already written
Markdown posts. So converting existing Markdown files to Org would be
purely the user's choice, your choice -- but that's by no means a
necessity if you want to start using =ox-hugo=.

.. And if at some point, you want to stop using =ox-hugo=, you still
have the exported Markdown files.

**** Org Hugo Auto Export feature now a /minor mode/ -- <2019-01-03 Thu>
***** Changes needed to be done in user config
1. Do *not* require ~ox-hugo-auto-export~ any more!
   - For now, you will get a warning each time you do that
     /require/. But in few weeks, the old ~ox-hugo-auto-export.el~
     file will be deleted from this project, and then doing that
     /require/ will throw an error.
   #+begin_note
   The ~ox-hugo-auto-export.el~ has been deleted from this project. So
   doing that /require/ will throw an error now. -- <2019-04-15 Mon>
   #+end_note
2. Make these changes in your ~.dir-locals.el~ or File Local Variables
   as applicable:
   |---------------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
   | Auto-export on save | Earlier                                | Now                                       |
   |---------------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
   | *Enable*            | ~(org-hugo-auto-export-on-save . t)~   | ~(eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode))~    |
   | *Disable*           | ~(org-hugo-auto-export-on-save . nil)~ | ~(eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode -1))~ |
   |---------------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
***** Summary
~org-hugo-auto-export-mode~ is a new minor mode that now ships with
~ox-hugo~. So the user doesn't need to do anything special to install
it --- it simply autoloads.

As a bonus, now ~M-x org-hugo-auto-export-mode~ can be used to toggle
the auto-exporting on and off in an Org buffer.

For history behind this change, see {{{issue(247)}}}. \\

#+begin_description
Quick start steps from downloading ~hugo~ to writing posts in Org mode
in Emacs.
#+end_description
1. Once you have [[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo][installed =hugo=​]], or downloaded a binary of [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases][its
   latest release (tested as of v0.91.2)]], type this to check that you
   have the =hugo= executable available:

   #+caption: Check that =hugo= is available
   #+name: code__hugo_version
   #+begin_src shell
   hugo version
   #+end_src

   #+begin_note
   Hugo version used when writing this post:

   #+begin_quote
   hugo v0.91.2-1798BD3F linux/amd64 BuildDate=2021-12-23T15:33:34Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
   #+end_quote
   #+end_note
2. =cd= to the directory in which you want to create your
   <<<Hugo site directory>>>, and run:

   #+caption: Create =quickstart= hugo site directory
   #+name: code__hugo_new_site
   #+begin_src shell
   hugo new site quickstart
   cd quickstart
   #+end_src

   In this directory, you will find a =config.toml= which is referred
   to as the "<<<site config>>>" file in Hugo docs and the
   documentation you find on this site.
3. Follow {{{doc(installation,,Installation)}}} page to ensure that
   =ox-hugo= is installed and available in your Emacs session.
4. Pick any theme. Here we will arbitrarily pick one of the popular
   themes: [[https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod][PaperMod]].
   - :sparkles: Using [[https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/][Hugo Modules]] :sparkles: ::
     This method is preferred, but requires the user to have ~go~ (at
     least version 1.12) installed. [[https://go.dev/doc/install][~go~ download link]].

     Make your Hugo site a Hugo Module (one time thing):

     #+begin_src shell
     hugo mod init <any string, like your repo or site URL will work, without https://>
     # example: hugo mod init github.com/user/reponame
     #+end_src

     Add this to your site config:
     #+begin_src conf-toml
     [module]
       [[module.imports]]
         path = "github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod"
     #+end_src

     And then run this in the terminal:
     #+begin_src shell
     hugo mod get -u
     #+end_src
   - Using ~git clone~ approach ::
     Clone the theme repo inside a ~themes/~ directory in your site dir.
     #+begin_src shell
     git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1
     #+end_src

     Add this to your site config:
     #+begin_src conf-toml
     theme = "PaperMod"
     #+end_src
5. Append these lines to the site config:
   #+begin_src conf-toml
   [markup.goldmark.renderer]
     unsafe = true
   #+end_src
   See the page on {{{doc(goldmark,,Goldmark)}}} for some more info on
   the =unsafe = true= setting.
6. Create a separate directory for Org content in the Hugo site base
   directory -- let's call it =content-org=.<<content-org-created>>
   #+begin_src shell
   # In Hugo site directory
   mkdir content-org
   #+end_src
7. Start the Hugo server in the Hugo site directory:
   #+begin_example
   hugo server --buildDrafts --navigateToChanged
   #+end_example

   You will see a message like:
   #+begin_quote
   Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/
   #+end_quote
   Navigate to that address in your browser.
8. Now, back in Emacs, with =ox-hugo= loaded, create a file called
   =all-posts.org= inside the =content-org/= created [[content-org-created][above]].
9. Paste this in that file
   #+caption: Basic post in Org
   #+name: code__basic_post_in_org
   #+begin_src org
   ,#+hugo_base_dir: ../

   ,* My first post                                             :tag1:@category1:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-first-post
   :END:
   This is my post body
   #+end_src
10. Take the cursor to the post heading and using the default
    /Shift+left/ (~S-<left>~) binding to mark that subtree as DONE.
11. Now save the file, take the cursor to the end of the post and type
    the bindings ~C-c C-e H H~.
12. You should see the site preview in your browser auto-update!
13. Now as you make changes in your post, save and do ~C-c C-e H H~ to
    see the post update in the browser.

*** Blogging Flow
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: blogging-flow
:END:
There are 2 major blogging flows that can be used with this package:
1. One post per Org subtree (preferred)
   - Export only the *current* post Org subtree, or
   - Export all valid Hugo post subtrees in a loop.
2. One post per Org file
   - This works but you won't be able to leverage Org-specific
     benefits like tag and property inheritance, use of TODO states to
     translate to post =draft= state, auto weight calculation for
     pages, taxonomies and menu items, etc.

See the [[*Org Capture Setup][Org Capture Setup]] page to see how to quickly create new posts.

See the [[*Auto-export on Saving][Auto-export on saving]] page to learn how to setup up seeing
live-preview of the Hugo-rendered HTML each time you do =C-x C-s= in
the Org file. That section explains how to set that up for either of
the above two blogging flows.
*** Goldmark (Hugo v0.60+)
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: goldmark
:END:
Since Hugo v0.60.0, the default Markdown-parser has switched to the
[[https://commonmark.org/][CommonMark]]-compliant [[https://github.com/yuin/goldmark][Goldmark]]. The previously default Markdown-parser
[[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]] is not compliant with any spec, and has many bugs (for
which ~ox-hugo~ needs to keep adding workarounds).

See [[https://gohugo.io/news/0.60.0-relnotes/][these Hugo v0.60.0 release notes]] to learn more.

So unless there's a strong reason for an ~ox-hugo~ user to keep on
using Blackfriday, _please switch to Goldmark_. You will need to start
using Hugo v0.60.0 or newer for that.
**** Enable "unsafe" HTML
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: enable-unsafe-html
:END:
Having said that, Goldmark/Hugo come with their own set of issues or
regressions in the way the Markdown parsing happens when compared to
Blackfriday, but they are not as bad compared to supporting
Blackfriday.

For ~ox-hugo~ to keep working well with Goldmark or Hugo v0.60+, it is
_necessary_ to add this to your Hugo site's ~config.toml~:

#+begin_src toml
[markup.goldmark.renderer]
  unsafe = true
#+end_src

/While that setting sounds scary, all that does is allow have inline
HTML in your Markdown, *as CommonMark allows!*/
*** Troubleshooting
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: troubleshooting
:END:
**** Exports with mixed unix and dos/windows style line endings
Based on your emacs configuration, you could end up exporting a
Markdown file that has a mix of unix-style (~"\n"~) and dos-style
(~"\r\n"~) line endings. This will confuse Hugo and it would then see
unix-style newline as just a whitespace. So now the unix-style line
breaks in Markdown that were supposed to create paragraph breaks will
be /seen/ as just a whitespace and those paragraph breaks will
disappear!

One scenario where this is happen is if (i) you have a Windows OS, but
(ii) you set the default ~buffer-file-coding-system~ (~C-x RET f~) to
be ~utf-8-unix~, and then (iii) [[*Inlined SVGs][embedded a file like an SVG]] created in
Windows. Here, your Org buffer will have unix-style line endings, but
the SVG created outside Emacs will have dos-style line endings. So you
end up exporting a file with mixed line endings.

Here are some possible fixes:
- Consistent line endings :: Figure out a way for the externally
  created file to have the line endings consistent with your Emacs
  buffers. Taking the above example, find a way for that SVG to have
  unix-style line endings as well.
- ~org-export-coding-system~ :: If you are setting
  ~buffer-file-coding-system~ to be a non-default value in your OS
  environment, set ~org-export-coding-system~ to be that same value!
- Override ~ox-hugo~ export coding system :: If you don't want to sync
  up these two variables, add the below advice to your Emacs
  config. /Below example overrides the export coding system to
  ~utf-8-unix~ assuming that the user has set the
  ~buffer-file-encoding-system~ to the same value./

*** Hugo test site for this package
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: tests-site
:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU_OVERRIDE: :title "Try the test site"
:END:
A [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/main/test/site][site]] with bare-bones Hugo "theme" is used to live-test the
package --- you'll know why theme is double-quoted once you try out the
site on =hugo=.

Check out the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/main/test/site/content-org/all-posts.org][example single Org file]]. That is created for testing various
Org->Hugo content and meta-data translation features. [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/main/test/site/content/posts][Here]] are the
exported Markdown files.
**** How to try =ox-hugo= on that site?
1. Clone this repo:
   #+begin_example
   git clone -j8 https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo
   #+end_example
2. Ensure that [[https://go.dev/doc/install][~go~]], and ~pandoc-citeproc~ (at least version
   {{{pandoc_version}}}) are installed (more info
   {{{doc(contributing-guide,#contribute-to-code,here)}}}).
3. Start the =hugo= server:
   #+begin_example
   make serve HUGO_BASE_DIR=test/site
   #+end_example
4. Open =http://localhost:1337= in your browser.
5. In a different terminal, =cd= to the repo directory.
6. Run:
   #+begin_example
   make md
   #+end_example
7. In few seconds, hundreds of test posts will get created, with the
   =hugo server= aided preview in the browser zapping through each new
   created post.
**** Alternative way
1. Clone this repo.
   #+begin_example
   git clone -j8 https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo
   #+end_example
2. Ensure that [[https://go.dev/doc/install][~go~]], ~pandoc~ and ~pandoc-citeproc~ (at least version
   {{{pandoc_version}}}) are installed (more info
   {{{doc(contributing-guide,#contribute-to-code,here)}}}).
3. =cd= to the =test/site/= directory and do:
   #+begin_example
   hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
   #+end_example
4. Above command will mention the localhost where the site is
   served. Open that in your browser.
5. In emacs, ~(require 'ox-hugo)~ or evaluate the ~ox-hugo.el~ from
   the cloned repo.
6. Open the {{{ox-hugo-test-file}}} file.
7. ~C-c C-e H A~ -- That will export *all* subtrees in the file to
   Markdown files.
8. In few seconds, hundreds of test posts will get created, with the
   ~hugo server~ aided preview in the browser zapping through each new
   created post.

If you too have a site generated using this package, and have the Org
source of your site public, feel free to open a PR (updating just

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: org-meta-data-to-hugo-front-matter
:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU_OVERRIDE: :title "Org→Hugo front-matter"
:END:
**** Front-matter format
~ox-hugo~ supports exporting the front-matter in [[https://github.com/toml-lang/toml][TOML]] (default) or
YAML.

To change the default to YAML for your exports, add this to the top of
your Org files:
#+begin_src org
,#+hugo_front_matter_format: yaml
#+end_src

- Subtree-based exports only :: If you want only specific subtrees to
  have the front-matter exported to YAML format, add this to that
  subtree's property drawer:
  #+begin_src org
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_FORMAT: yaml
  :END:
  #+end_src
**** For subtree-based exports
When organizing the posts as Org *subtrees*, many Hugo front-matter
variables get set implicitly using the meta-data parsed from the posts
in Org.

Below, where /subtree/ is mentioned, it implies a *valid Hugo-post
subtree* i.e. an Org subtree that has the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property
set.

**** Date Formats
The =EXPORT_DATE= and other date-type properties support date in
either the [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8][RFC3339 date-time format]][fn:8] or the in-built Org

**** Defcustoms
***** =org-hugo-date-format=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-hugo-date-format
:END:
- Default value :: ="%Y-%m-%dT%T%z"=

This variable sets the date format used for exporting /date/
front-matter parameters like =date=, =publishDate=, =expiryDate=,
=lastmod=.

Note that the date format *must match* the date specification from
[[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8][RFC3339]].

Examples of RFC3339-compatible values for this variable:

|---------------------------+-----------------------------|
| Value                     | Example output              |
|---------------------------+-----------------------------|
| =%Y-%m-%dT%T%z= (default) | =2017-07-31T17:05:38-04:00= |
| =%Y-%m-%dT%T=             | =2017-07-31T17:05:38=       |
| =%Y-%m-%d=                | =2017-07-31=                |
|---------------------------+-----------------------------|

Do =C-h v org-hugo-date-format= for more information (within Emacs,
once the =ox-hugo= package is loaded).

***** =org-hugo-suppress-lastmod-period=
 - Default value :: =0.0=

A suppressing period (in seconds) during which the =lastmod= parameter
is not added to the front matter. The suppressing period is counted as
a delta between the =date= and =lastmod= parameters.

If the value is 86400.0, the =lastmod= parameter will not be added to the
front matter within 24 hours from the value of =date= parameter.

=lastmod= would be exported when you initially change the Org TODO
state to =DONE= by saving the file automatically with the following
conditions. Some users may not prefer this behavior.

| Variable                         | Value |
|----------------------------------+-------|
| org-hugo-auto-set-lastmod        | t     |
| org-log-done                     | time  |

In such case, you can suppress =lastmod= in the front-matter if you set
=org-hugo-suppress-lastmod-period= to =60.0= or other appropriate value.

Note that this variable is effective only if auto-setting of the
=lastmod= parameter is enabled i.e. if =org-hugo-auto-set-lastmod= or
=EXPORT_HUGO_AUTO_SET_LASTMOD= is non-nil.
**** File-based Exports
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dates-file-based-exports
:END:
In Org files meant for file-based exports, you simply set a value for
a =#+hugo_FOO= keyword (in most cases, for example =#+date= is one of
the exceptions) to set the =FOO= parameter in the exported
front-matter.

**** Subtree-based Exports
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dates-subtree-based-exports
:END:
The date meta-data can be set as Org properties in post subtrees,
similar to the keywords set for [[#dates-file-based-exports][File-based exports]]. But subtree-based
exports allow an even concise way to set those dates.
***** Date
This is interpreted from the Org [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-properties.html][Special Property]] =CLOSED=.

The =CLOSED= property is inserted once the post-subtree's =TODO= state
is set to =DONE= (~C-c C-t~), *if* the =org-log-done= variable is set
to ='time= (default is /nil/). This option can also be enabled on a
per-file-basis with =#+startup: logdone=.

Here's an example:
#+begin_src org
,* DONE My post
CLOSED: [2018-01-23 Tue 14:10]
Post content.
#+end_src

Above gets translated to =date = 2018-01-23T14:10:00-05:00= in
front-matter (TOML).

- NOTE :: Another variable =org-log-done-with-time= can be set to /nil/
          (default to =t=) if you would like the =CLOSED= time stamp
          to contain only the date, and not the time.

/You do not then need to explicitly set the =:EXPORT_DATE:= property./
***** Publish Date
This is interpreted from the Org Special Property =SCHEDULED=. The
idea is that you schedule a task for a /future/ date, just as you
would set a post to be published in /future/. This property is
set using the default ~C-c C-s~ binding in Org.

Here's an example:
#+begin_src org
,* My future post
SCHEDULED: <2060-01-26 Mon>
Post content.
#+end_src

Above gets translated to =publishDate = 2060-01-26T00:00:00-05:00= in
front-matter (TOML).

/You do not then need to explicitly set the =:EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE:=
property./
***** Expiry Date
This is set using the =:EXPORT_HUGO_EXPIRYDATE:= property.
***** Last modified
Like any other front-matter property, you can explicitly set the /last
modified/ date too, using the =:EXPORT_HUGO_LASTMOD:= property.

But what's the point of calling a property /last modified/, if you
forget to manually update that property *each time* you update the
post. SO =ox-hugo= takes care of that for you.. if you set the property
=:EXPORT_HUGO_AUTO_SET_LASTMOD:= to a non-nil value.

It's normal for one to choose to auto-set the /last modified/ date for
all the posts. So instead of setting the above property for each post
individually, it might be more convenient to simply put
=#+hugo_auto_set_lastmod: t= at the top of the file.
*** Image Links
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: image-links
:END:
This section will provides few alternatives for linking to images in
Org files in a way that's compatible with =ox-hugo= and Hugo.

For the sake of the below explanation, let's have the /HUGO_BASE_DIR/
(the directory containing the Hugo site's =config.toml= file) be
=~/hugo/=. Then the Hugo /static/ directory will be =~/hugo/static/=.
**** References to files in the /static/ directory
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: references-to-files-in-the-static-directory
:END:
Now if you have a file =~/hugo/static/images/foo.png=, =ox-hugo= makes
it convenient for you to reference that image by simply
=/images/foo.png=.

#+begin_note
Note that this is *not* the default behavior of other Org exporters.
#+end_note

But in the case of Hugo, as the referenced file will /normally/ be in
the Hugo /static/ directory, =ox-hugo= allows the =/images/foo.png=
style of short reference *if* that is a valid path under that Hugo
site's /static/ directory.

See the below examples on how to reference images in different ways:
***** Inline image -- Unhyperlinked
#+caption: Unhyperlinked image (don't click it)
#+name: fig__unhyperlinked_image
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo-200px.png]]
#+begin_src org
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo-200px.png]]
#+end_src
***** Inline image -- Also hyperlinked to an image
#+caption: Image hyperlinked to an image (click it!)
#+name: fig__hyperlinked_image
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo-200px.png][file:/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo-50px.png]]
#+begin_src org
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo-200px.png][file:/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo-50px.png]]
#+end_src
This style of link is normally used if you want to link a low
resolution image to its higher resolution version.
- NOTE 1 :: The =file:= prefix has to be used in the *Description
            component* of the Org link.
- NOTE 2 :: The =file:= prefix can be used for the *Link component* of
            the Org link too --- it doesn't hurt.
- NOTE 3 :: A space in the path in the *Description component* of the
            Org link has to be encoded to "%20".
***** Regular link to an image
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo-200px.png][Click here to see org-mode-unicorn-logo-200px.png]]
#+begin_src org
[[/images/org-mode-unicorn-logo-200px.png][Click here to see org-mode-unicorn-logo-200px.png]]
#+end_src
This style of linking will work for references to non-image files in
the /static/ directory too.
**** References to files *outside* the /static/ directory
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: references-to-files-outside-the-static-directory
:END:
This is a unique feature of =ox-hugo=.

(i) If a reference is made to a file outside the Hugo /static/
directory, *and* (ii) if it has one of the extensions listed in
=org-hugo-external-file-extensions-allowed-for-copying=, then that
file is copied by =ox-hugo= to the /static/ directory.

Here is an example link:
#+begin_src org
[[~/some-dir/static/images/foo.png]]
#+end_src
***** Source path contains =/static/=
If you link to files outside of the Hugo =static= directory, just
ensure that the path contains the string =/static/= /if you like to
preserve the directory structure/. Necessary directories are then
created inside the /static/ directory to preserve the structure.

Example translations between outside =static= directory paths to the
copied location inside =static=:

#+caption: Where files get copied to if their path contains =static/=
#+attr_html: :class sane-table
|----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File location outside =static=   | Copied-to location inside =static=        | Explanation                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =~/temp/static/images/foo.png=   | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/images/foo.png=   | If the *outside* path has =/static/= in it, the directory structure after that is preserved when copied. |
| =~/temp/static/img/foo.png=      | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/img/foo.png=      | (same as above)                                                                                          |
| =~/temp/static/foo.png=          | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/foo.png=          | (same as above)                                                                                          |
| =~/temp/static/articles/zoo.pdf= | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/articles/zoo.pdf= | (same as above)                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

See the {{{doc(usage,#before-you-export,Usage → Before you export)}}}
section to learn how to set the *HUGO_BASE_DIR*.
***** Source path does not contain =/static/=
Here is an example link where the source path does not contain
=/static/=:
#+begin_src org
[[~/some-dir/bar/foo.png]]
#+end_src

In this case, that file is copied directly to the
=org-hugo-default-static-subdirectory-for-externals= sub-directory
(=ox-hugo/= by default) within the Hugo static directory. No directory
structure generation happens in this case.

#+caption: Where files get copied to if their path *does not* contain =static/=
#+attr_html: :class sane-table
|--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File location outside =static= | Copied-to location inside =static=       | Explanation                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =~/temp/bar/baz/foo.png=       | =<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/static/ox-hugo/foo.png= | Here, as the *outside* path does not have =/static/= in it, the file is copied to the =ox-hugo/= dir in Hugo =static/= dir. |
|--------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
***** Disable auto-copying
This auto-copying behavior can be disabled completely by setting
=org-hugo-external-file-extensions-allowed-for-copying= to /nil/.. but
you might not want that if you keep your files *outside* the Hugo
static directory.
**** Hiding figure caption numbers
The "Figure <number>:" part of the figure captions can be hidden by
adding this to the CSS:

#+begin_src css
.figure-number {
  display: none;
}
#+end_src
*** Source blocks
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: source-blocks
:END:
=ox-hugo= tries to generate Markdown with fenced code blocks if
possible. It also supports exporting source blocks with line numbers
and/or highlighting enabled for specific lines.
**** Code Fences
By default, the =HUGO_CODE_FENCE= property is non-nil. So the code
blocks will be exported with GitHub-style code-fencing with
triple-backticks when possible.

For example, below Org source block:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(message "Hello")
,#+end_src
#+end_src

will export to:

#+begin_src md
```emacs-lisp
(message "Hello")
```
#+end_src

- Note :: It is necessary to set the Hugo site config variable
  =markup.highlight.codeFences= to =true= (which is the default at
  least as of [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/bfb9613a14ab2d93a4474e5486d22e52a9d5e2b3][Hugo v0.60.0]]) for syntax highlighting to work for fenced
  code blocks.

If you want to always use the Hugo [[#highlight-shortcode][=highlight= shortcode]], set the
=HUGO_CODE_FENCE= property to =nil=.
**** Line numbers
Line numbers can be enabled/configured using the Org =-n= / =+n=
syntax. See the Info node [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html][=(org) Literal Examples=]] for more
information.

Here are some examples fetched from the "Source blocks with line
number annotation" test case in the {{{ox-hugo-test-file}}}.

#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::#source-block-line-number-cases" :only-contents t
***** Line number Style (*linenos*)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: linenos
:END:
When line numbers are enabled, by default the "table" style is used
for line numbers. This is specified using the [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlight-shortcode][=linenos= argument to
the =highlight= shortcode]].

This default can be overridden using the =:linenos= parameter in the
source block header.

*Example usage*: If a user has enabled the line numbers by default by
using something like this in the site's =config.toml=:

#+begin_src toml
[markup]
  [markup.highlight]
    lineNos = true
#+end_src

, they can disable printing of line numbers for selected source blocks
by adding =:linenos false= to their headers.

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src emacs-lisp :linenos false
(message "hello")
(message "bye")
,#+end_src
#+end_src

- Valid values of ~linenos~ :: ~table~ (default), ~true~, ~false~,
  ~inline~

/The same =:linenos= header arg works for example blocks too./
**** Highlighting
Implementing this feature was interesting, because while Org doesn't
have a syntax to enable highlighting only specific lines, Hugo
supports highlighting using the =hl_lines= attribute to [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting#highlighting-in-code-fences][code fences]]
(Hugo v0.60.0+) or its ~highlight~ shortcode.

So the challenge was to present that "lines to be highlighted"
information in the Org source in a nice format and then translate that
to the =hl_lines= attribute with the required format at the time of
exporting.

It involved /hacking/ the =org-babel-exp-code=. See [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2017-10/msg00300.html][this discussion on
the =emacs-orgmode= thread]] if interested.

This feature is implemented by using a parameter called =:hl_lines= in
the header of source blocks. This parameter is specific to =ox-hugo=,
and that's why implementing this needed that hack.

If a user wants to highlight lines 1, and then 3 to 5, they would add
=:hl_lines 1,3-5= to the source block header.
***** Noweb refences                                               :noexport:
Below 2 include statements fetch the noweb references used in the code
inserted by other include statements in the following sections.

They are included to get the /noweb/ references working but they do
not need to be exported.

#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::#source-block-with-line-numbers-examples"
#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::#source-block-with-line-highlighting-examples"
***** Highlighting without line numbers
#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::#source-blocks-with-highlighting-no-linenums" :only-contents t
***** Highlighting with line numbers
The Org source for the below is similar to the above, except that the
=-n= switch is also added to enable the line numbers.

#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::#source-blocks-with-highlighting-with-linenums-not-starting-from-1" :only-contents t
**** ~highlight~ shortcode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: highlight-shortcode
:END:
The Hugo [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting#highlight-shortcode][=highlight= shortcode]] is automatically used instead of code
fences (even with this property at a non-nil value) if one of these is
true:
- ~HUGO_CODE_FENCE~ is set to /nil/.
- "Blackfriday mode" is enabled (~HUGO_GOLDMARK~ is /nil/) *and*
  either the [[*Line numbers][line numbering]] or [[*Highlighting][highlighting]] feature is enabled, or if
  the [[#linenos][=:linenos= parameter]] is specified in the source block header.

By default, ~ox-hugo~ tries to avoid using this shortcode because it's
more bug-prone than the code fences ({{{issue(161)}}}), and also the
code fences are more /Markdownish/ :smile:.
**** Hiding source block caption numbers
The "Code Snippet <number>:" part of the source block captions can be
hidden by adding this to the CSS:

#+begin_src css
.src-block-number {
  display: none;
}
#+end_src
**** Code References
~ox-hugo~ generates code references hyperlinked to line numbers of
source and example blocks when using the ~(ref:REF)~ syntax in the
blocks as explained in [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html][Literal Examples]] section of the Org manual.

#+begin_quote
Org interprets strings like ~(ref:name)~ as labels, and use them as
targets for special hyperlinks like ~[[(name)]]~ — i.e., the
reference name enclosed in single parenthesis.

You can also add a ~-r~ switch which removes the labels from the
source code.
#+end_quote

#+begin_note
One convenience feature added by ~ox-hugo~ is that the ~-n~ is always
implied when code references are detected in the source or example
blocks.
#+end_note

- Note :: It is the user's responsibility to ensure that all code ref
  labels used within a single post are unique.
***** Code references exported with labels
As an example, this in Org source:

# Below the '-l "((%s))"' switch is used to change the reference label
# format so that the labels in the nested emacs-lisp src block in this
# Org src block don't get parsed as this Org block's references.
#+begin_src org -l "((%s))"
,#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(save-excursion                 (ref:sc)
   (goto-char (point-min))      (ref:jump)
,#+end_src

In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position. [[(jump)][Line (jump)]] jumps to
~point-min~.
#+end_src

exports to:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(save-excursion                 (ref:sc)
   (goto-char (point-min))      (ref:jump)
#+end_src

In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position. [[(jump)][Line (jump)]] jumps to
~point-min~.
***** Code references exported *without* labels
When the ~-r~ switch is used in the header, the code ref labels are
removed from the exported code block, and the labels in code ref link
descriptions are replaced with line numbers.

As an example, this in Org source:

# Below the '-l "((%s))"' switch is used to change the reference label
# format so that the labels in the nested emacs-lisp src block in this
# Org src block don't get parsed as this Org block's references.
#+begin_src org -l "((%s))"
,#+begin_src emacs-lisp -r
(save-excursion                 (ref:sc1)
   (goto-char (point-min))      (ref:jump1)
,#+end_src

In line [[(sc1)]] we remember the current position. [[(jump1)][Line (jump1)]] jumps to
~point-min~.
#+end_src

exports to:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp -r
(save-excursion                 (ref:sc1)
   (goto-char (point-min))      (ref:jump1)
#+end_src

In line [[(sc1)]] we remember the current position. [[(jump1)][Line (jump1)]] jumps to
~point-min~.
*** Equations
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: equations
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :mathjax true
:END:
#+begin_description
Supporting {{{latex}}} equations
#+end_description
By default, the inline and block equations are exported to Markdown in
a format that can be rendered using [[https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted][MathJax]]. /You can find one MathJax
config example [[#mathjax-config-example][below]]./
**** Inline equations
- Inline equations are wrapped between =\(= and =\)=.
  - =$= wrapping also works, but it is not preferred as it comes with
    restrictions like "there should be no whitespace between the
    equation and the =$= delimiters".

    So =$ a=b $= will not work (it will look like: $ a=b $), but
    =$a=b$= will work (it will look like: $a=b$).

    On the other hand, both =\(a=b\)= (it will look like: \(a=b\)) and
    =\( a=b \)= (it will look like: \( a=b \)) will work.
- One-per-line equations are wrapped between =\[= and =\]= or =$$=
  delimiters.

For example, below in Org:
#+begin_src org
LaTeX formatted equation: \( E = -J \sum_{i=1}^N s_i s_{i+1} \)
#+end_src

will look like this in Hugo rendered HTML:

LaTeX formatted equation: \( E = -J \sum_{i=1}^N s_i s_{i+1 }\)

*Don't see this in Markdown, see what it looks after Hugo has
processed it.* --- =ox-hugo= does some heavy escaping to get around a
Blackfriday issue with supporting MathJax syntax equations (that Org
supports).

Here's another example, taken from [[https://orgmode.org/manual/LaTeX-fragments.html][(org) LaTeX fragments]].

Below in Org:
#+begin_example
If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be either
$$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \]
#+end_example

renders to:

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be either
$$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \]

(Note that the last two equations show up on their own lines.)
**** {{{latex}}} Environments
=ox-hugo= support {{{latex}}} environments.

So below in Org buffer:

#+begin_src org
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
C = W\log_{2} (1+\mathrm{SNR})
\end{equation}
#+end_src

will export as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
C = W\log_{2} (1+\mathrm{SNR})
\end{equation}

Equation referencing will also work[fn:3]. So =\ref{eq:1}= will render as
\ref{eq:1}.
**** Examples
You can find many examples by looking at {{{testtag(equations)}}}.

****** Marking files to not be exported
Note that if you want to prevent a file from getting exported, you can
assign a special tag to the whole file (example: =no_no_dont_export=).
- For /per-subtree/ flow, that /don't export/ tag *has to be set using
  the =#+filetags= keyword*[fn:2].
- For /per-file/ flow, that same /dont' export/ tag *has to be set
  using the =#+hugo_tags= keyword* (because ~#+filetags~ keyword does
  not work for /per-file/ flow. See [[* File-based Export]]).

Then in your export setup, add that special tag to the
=org-export-exclude-tags= variable. You can grep through this repo for
the special tag =dont_export_during_make_test= that is used to mark
few Org files to not be exported when running the

***** Categories
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: categories--subtree-based-export
:END:
Categories for subtree-based exports can be set using the
=EXPORT_HUGO_CATEGORIES= property or the usual Org tags in the post
subtree heading (but tags with =@= prefix).

#+name: tab__subtree_based_export_category_precedence
#+caption: Subtree-based export Category parsing precedence

|          2 | Tags in =#+filetags= + headings with =@= prefix (preferred) |
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|

For subtree-based exports, the Hugo front-matter =categories= values
are derived from Org tags set for the post subtree heading (if
=EXPORT_HUGO_CATEGORIES= is not set), but only the ones prefixed with
*@*.

As with the tags, by default, the categories (Org tags with "@"
prefix) from parent headings, and the ones set in the =#+filetags=
keyword too get inherited (as the default value of
=org-use-tag-inheritance= is =t=).

#+begin_note
If the tag inheritance doesn't work as expected, check the value of
=org-use-tag-inheritance=.
#+end_note

#+end_src
Above, the "My post" will end up have all tags ("tag1", "tag2",
"tag3") and all categories ("cat1", "cat2", "cat3") if
=org-use-tag-inheritance= is =t=.

#+end_src
**** Hyphens and Spaces in Org tags (and categories)
Hyphens and spaces are not allowed in Org tags (=* Heading :TAG:=).

So =ox-hugo= converts:
- *single underscores* to hyphens if =org-hugo-prefer-hyphen-in-tags=
  is set to non-nil (default).
- *double underscores* to spaces if =org-hugo-allow-spaces-in-tags= is
  set to non-nil (default).

So an Org tag *abc_def* will be exported as /tag/ *"abc-def"*, and
*abc__def* will be exported as /tag/ *"abc def"*.

The same applies to Org tags with prefix =@= which will be exported as
/categories/. So *@abc_def* will be exported as /category/
*"abc-def"*, and *@abc__def* as /category/ *"abc def"*.

To export a tag or category with an underscore, use 3 consecutive
underscores. So an Org tag *abc___def* will be exported as /tag/
*"abc_def"* (and the same for categories). If you rather prefer to
always export /single underscores/ as underscores, set
=org-hugo-prefer-hyphen-in-tags= to nil.

#+begin_note
These two variables *also affect* the tags set via =#+filetags=
keyword.
#+end_note

These variables do not affect the tags set via keywords =#+hugo_tags=,
=#+hugo_categories= or =#+keywords= (or their respective subtree
property forms), because Org keywords and properties allow using the
hyphen and space (/in "double-quoted strings"/) characters. So the
underscores in these keywords remain untransformed on export.
**** Sub-heading Tags
Sub-heading tags are exported wrapped in HTML ~span~ tags to the right
of the exported heading if ~org-export-with-tags~ is non-nil (default)
or if ~#+options: tags:t~ is used.

The ~span~ tags are best formatted using CSS. Here's one example:

#+begin_src css
.tag span {
    background: lightgrey;
    font-size: small;
    padding: 0.1rem 0.2rem;
    margin: 0.2rem;
}
#+end_src

*** Table of Contents
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: org-toc
:END:
Hugo can automatically parse the Markdown content and auto-create a
Table of Contents. See its documentation on [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/][Table of Contents]]. So
=ox-hugo= does not generate the TOC using Org by default.

The only advantage of using Hugo-generated TOC is that it does not
clutter the Markdown source.

Though, the advantage of Org-generated TOC is that you get finer
control on:
- *Where* to include the TOC --- Location of the =#+toc= keyword in the
  Org content.
- How many headings to include in the TOC --- /Example: =#+toc:
  headlines 2=/ or =:EXPORT_OPTIONS: toc:2=.
- Whether you want *all* the headings in the TOC to be numbered or
  not --- See =org-hugo-export-with-section-numbers=.
- Whether you want *only some* headings numbered (both in post body
  and the TOC) --- Set the =UNNUMBERED= property of that heading to
  =t=.
- Whether you want to list the sub-headings *only from the current
  heading in the post* --- /Example: ~#+toc: headlines 1 local~/.
- Whether you want to list the sub-headings from a specified heading
  in the current post using the ~:target~ attribute. See the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Table-of-Contents.html][Org
  Manual -- Table of Contents]] section for its example.

If you want to use the Org-generated TOC instead of the Hugo-generated
one, do one of the following:
1. As the default is to use the Hugo-generated TOC, the Org-generated
   TOC has to be enabled explicitly. To do this for all your ~ox-hugo~
   generated posts, set the =org-hugo-export-with-toc= variable to a
   non-nil value like =t= or =2=.
2. Org-generated TOC can be enabled per-post by either setting the
   =EXPORT_OPTIONS= subtree property (for subtree-based exports) or
   the =OPTIONS= keyword (for file-based exports) to a non-nil value,
   like ~toc:t~ or ~toc:2~.
3. Above two options will insert the TOC between the front-matter and
   the Markdown content. If you'd like to insert the Org-generated TOC
   anywhere else in the post, you can do it using the =#+toc=
   keyword.. Example: =#+toc: headlines 2=.

See the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Table-of-Contents.html][Table of Contents]] section in the Org manual for more info.

/Note that =ox-hugo= does not support =#+toc: listings= and =#+toc:
tables=./
**** "Table of Contents" heading
The "Table of Contents" heading is inserted as a plain HTML ~div~
element. Users can customize the looks of that ~div~ by setting CSS
rules for ~.ox-hugo-toc .heading~.

Here is an example CSS rule for that:
#+begin_src css
.ox-hugo-toc .heading {
    font-size: 1.8em;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-align: center;
}
#+end_src
**** Excluding Org-generated TOC from Hugo summaries
As mentioned above, if you use Hugo-generated TOC, the advantage is
that the TOC is not inserted physically in the content Markdown
file.

But with the Org-generated TOC, it *will* be. The disadvantage of that
is that the =.Summary= in Hugo will consider the TOC! So your TOC will
show up in places you don't expect.. like summaries in post lists, in
twitter cards, etc.

But.. there's a way to fix that, because =ox-hugo= inserts a special
comment ~<!--endtoc-->~ at the end of the inserted TOC.

Using that special comment, this [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/summary_minus_toc.html][=summary_minus_toc.html=]] partial
tries to get the "summary you mean". This partial is used by the
=ox-hugo= test site.
- You can find examples of where this partial can be used in
  [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/opengraph.html][=opengraph.html=]] and  [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/twitter_cards.html][=twitter_cards.html=]] partials, also used in
  the test site.

/Note that you would need to use the =summary_minus_toc.html= partial
wherever you do not intend to have TOC included in the summary (for
example, in the Opengraph =og:description= meta tag)./
*** Table Styling
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: table-styling
:END:
Classic =ox-html= allows setting table attributes directly using
=#+attr_html=. But specifying the attributes directly in the =<table>=
tag is [[https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html-markup-20110113/table.html#table-constraints][admonished in HTML5]] .. /and so Hugo/Blackfriday do not allow
any way to directly insert attributes *inside* the =<table>= tag./

So a workaround is used by =ox-hugo=.. it wraps the tables with =<div>=
tags with classes, which a user can then use to style the tables using
CSS.. /just as recommended by HTML5/ :smile:.

=ox-hugo= can style different tables in different ways on the same
page, with the help of =#+attr_html= and =#+attr_css= (*introduced in
=ox-hugo=*) attributes.

1. =#+attr_html= is used to assign one or more classes to a table.
   #+begin_src org
   ,#+attr_html: :class sane-table
   #+end_src
   - Wraps the table in =<div>= tags with =sane-table= class.
   - Sets style from =#+attr_css=, if present, for =.sane-table table=
     scope.

   or

   #+begin_src org
   ,#+attr_html: :class zebra-striping sane-table
   #+end_src
   - Wraps the table in =<div>= tags with =zebra-striping= *and*
     =sane-table= classes.
   - Sets style from =#+attr_css=, if present, *only* for the
     =.zebra-striping table= scope i.e. only for the first class
     listed in that attribute. Specifying multiple classes to a table
     is useful if you want that table to inherit the styling from CSS
     rules for multiple classes.
2. =#+attr_css= is used to assign the specified styles to the
   class of the table it precedes.

   Examples:
   #+begin_src org
   ,#+attr_css: :width 80%
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src org
   ,#+attr_css: :text-align left
   #+end_src

   - If =#+attr_html= is used to specify the table class, the style is
     applied to the first of the list of classes (as explained above).
   - If =#+attr_html= is *not* used to set a custom class name for the
     table, the class name is auto-derived..
     - If the table =#+caption= is present, the class name is
       =table-N= where "N" is the /Nth/ captioned table on that page.
     - If the table is not captioned, the class name is always
       =table-nocaption=. So.. if you want to have different styling
       for different tables, make sure that you either set their
       custom class name using =#+attr_html=, or caption them.


- All tables exported with the =<div>= tags have the class
  =ox-hugo-table=. This can be useful if you want to set a common
  style for all those tables.
- =#+attr_css= applies styling only to the =.CLASS table= scope. So if
  you want more styling i.e. for other elements like =td=, =tr=, etc,
  you would need to do that in an =#+export_begin html= block.

  Example:

  #+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_export hugo
  <style>
  .my-table th,
  .my-table td {
      padding: 20px;
      text-align: left;
  }
  </style>
  ,#+end_export
  ,#+caption: Table with verbatim CSS
  ,#+attr_html: :class my-table
  | h1  | h2  | h3  |
  |-----+-----+-----|
  | abc | def | ghi |
  #+end_src

**** Hiding table caption numbers
The "Table <number>:" part of the table captions can be hidden by
adding this to the CSS:

#+begin_src css
.table-number {
  display: none;
}
#+end_src
*** Details and summary
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: details-and-summary
:END:
The "details" Org Special Block (~#+begin_details~ .. ~#+end_details~)
is used for generating the Details disclosure elements [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details][~<details>~]]
and ~<summary>~.

The summaries nested in these "details" Org Special blocks are created
using the "summary" Org Special block ~#+begin_summary~
.. ~#+end_summary~.
**** Regular details disclosure
#+begin_src org
,#+begin_details
,#+begin_summary
Why is this in *green*?
,#+end_summary
You will learn that later below in [[#details-css][CSS]] section.
,#+end_details
#+end_src
will render like below:
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Why is this in *green*?
#+end_summary
You will learn that later below in [[#details-css][CSS]] section.
#+end_details
**** Details disclosure without details or without summary
- If the ~details~ Special Block does not contain the ~summary~
  Special Block, a details-only disclosure will be created.
  #+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_details
  Here are the /details/.
  ,#+end_details
  #+end_src
  will render like below:
  #+begin_details
  Here are the /details/.
  #+end_details
  #+begin_note
  In the absence of summary, most browsers will use a default string
  "Details" for the summary.
  #+end_note
- If the ~details~ Special Block contains *only* the ~summary~ Special
  Block, a summary-only disclosure will be created.
  #+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_details
  ,#+begin_summary
  Some Summary
  ,#+end_summary
  ,#+end_details
  #+end_src
  will render like below:
  #+begin_details
  #+begin_summary
  Some Summary
  #+end_summary
  #+end_details
  #+begin_note
  Even if the details part is absent, the collapsing triangle will
  still be rendered. But nothing will show up when that triangle is
  uncollapsed.. /as the details portion is not there/.
  #+end_note
**** Disclosure widget open by default
The ~<details>~ disclosure widget is initially closed by default. But
it can be made to show up opened by default by adding the ~:open t~
attribute like this:
#+begin_src org
,#+attr_html: :open t
,#+begin_details
,#+begin_summary
Some Summary
,#+end_summary
Here are the /details/.
,#+end_details
#+end_src
will render like below:
#+attr_html: :open t
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Some Summary
#+end_summary
Here are the /details/.
#+end_details
#+begin_note
For open-by-default disclosure widgets, the ~#+attr_html~ keyword
specifically needs to contain ~:open t~.
#+end_note
**** CSS rules for these widgets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: details-css
:END:
- ~details summary~ will apply to the /summary/ portion of the
  disclosure widget.
- ~details .details~ will apply to the /details/ portion of the
  disclosure widget.

#+html: <style>.green { color: green; }</style>
#+html: <style>.blue { color: blue; }</style>

For instance, the CSS rules set using below caused all the disclosure
/summaries/ to show in <span class="green">green</span>, and all the
disclosure /details/ to show in <span class=blue>blue</span>.
#+begin_src org
#+html: <style>details summary { color: green; }</style>
#+html: <style>details .details { color: blue; }</style>
#+end_src

#+html: <style>details summary { color: green; }</style>
#+html: <style>details .details { color: blue; }</style>
*** Author
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: author
:END:
The ~author~ front-matter parameter is designed to always be a list or
an array, so that multiple authors can be supported.
**** Default Author
The ~author~ parameter is set to always export by default (as the
default value of ~org-export-with-author~ is ~t~).

The author name defaults to ~user-full-name~. You can choose to either
customize this variable in your Emacs config, or manually set the
author name by adding the below to the top of your Org file:
#+begin_src org
,#+author: FirstName LastName
#+end_src

If using /per-subtree/ flow, and if you want to specify the author (or
override the value set by the above ~#+author~ keyword) differently
for all posts under a subtree, add below in that subtree's property
drawer:
#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_AUTHOR: Firstname LastName
:END:
#+end_src

Either of above two author-setting methods will export to this TOML
front-matter:
#+begin_src toml
author = ["FirstName LastName"]
#+end_src
**** Multiple Authors
Multiple authors can be specified by either:
- Using multiple ~#+author~ keywords, or
  #+begin_src org
  ,#+author: FAuthor1 LAuthor1
  ,#+author: FAuthor2 LAuthor2
  #+end_src
- Specifying comma-separated authors, if setting them in subtree
  properties.
  #+begin_src org
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_AUTHOR: FAuthor1 LAuthor1, FAuthor2 LAuthor2
  :END:
  #+end_src

Either of above two author-setting methods will export to this TOML
front-matter:
#+begin_src toml
author = ["FAuthor1 LAuthor1", "FAuthor2 LAuthor2"]
#+end_src
**** Disabling exporting of ~author~ parameter
Author exporting can be disabled using any of these ways:
- To disable author exporting only for a specific Org file, add below
  to the top of that file:
  #+begin_src org
  ,#+options: author:nil
  #+end_src
- If using /per-subtree/ flow, and if you want to disable author
  exporting only for posts under specific subtrees, add below in the
  property drawers of those:
  #+begin_src org
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_OPTIONS: author:nil
  :END:
  #+end_src
- To disable author exporting by default for all exporters (not just
  ~ox-hugo~), set ~org-export-with-author~ to ~nil~ in your Emacs
  config.
**** Tweaking your Hugo template to support /list/ ~author~
#+begin_note
The ~author~ front-matter parameter is *always* exported as a
TOML/YAML list.
#+end_note
If you already have Hugo posts with the ~author~ front-matter already
set, it is possible that those values exist as single string values
instead of lists.

If so, you can use a snippet like the [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-onyx-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/author.html][~author.html~ partial]] used by
this doc site to parse the ~author~ parameter correctly (whether it's
a plain string or a list of strings).
***** Forcing ~author~ to be a /string/ (alternative)
If you are not comfortable with Hugo templates, you can alternatively
force the ~author~ param to be a plain /string/ instead of a /list/,
by setting it as a /custom/ front-matter parameter:
#+begin_src org
#+author:
#+hugo_custom_front_matter: :author "FirstName LastName"
#+end_src

- Note :: Remember to set the default author name to nil if doing this,
          by setting the ~#+author~ keyword (or ~:EXPORT_AUTHOR:~
          property) to /nothing/.
*** Hugo Summary Splitter
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: hugo-summary-splitter
:END:
#+begin_description
Manual splitting of Hugo summary.
#+end_description
In Hugo, the point of split between the summary and main content can
be specified using the ~<!--more-->~ HTML snippet. See [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/#manual-summary-splitting][its
documentation]] for more information.

The recommended way to do that in the Org files you export using
~ox-hugo~ is to use ~#+hugo: more~.

Here's an example:
#+begin_src org
My post summary.
,#+hugo: more
My post content.
#+end_src
*** COMMENT Hyperlinks
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: hyperlinks
:END:
**** External Links
**** Internal Links
** Enhancements
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_MENU: :menu "6.enhancements"
:END:
*** Auto-export on Saving
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: auto-export-on-saving
:END:
Wouldn't it be awesome if you can see the live-preview of your
Hugo-rendered post each time you saved your post in Org?

Well.. you can do that with these steps, which apply to both
/per-subtree/ and /per-file/ flows:
**** First time setup
***** Step {{{n}}}: Enable minor mode =org-hugo-auto-export-mode=
This minor mode is disabled by default. It can be enabled separately
at project level or file level.
#+begin_note
Note that once you update the ~.dir-locals.el~ file or file-local
Variables as shown below, you will be prompted by Emacs to tell it if
those settings are safe. Hit ~!~ in that prompt to says /yes/ and to
save that choice for future Emacs sessions.
#+end_note
****** Enable for the whole project
If you want to enable auto-exporting for the whole project, add this
to the ~.dir-locals.el~ file in the project root:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(("content-org/"
  . ((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))))
#+end_src
Above assumes that the Org files are in the /"content-org/"/ directory
(at any nested level in there) relative to that =.dir-locals.el= file:
#+begin_example
<HUGO_BASE_DIR>
  ├── config.toml
  ├── content
  ├── content-org      <-- Org files in there
  ├── static
  ├── themes
  └── .dir-locals.el
#+end_example

If you have the Org file directly in the project root or in the same
directory as the ~.dir-locals.el~, add this in that file instead:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))
#+end_src

Note that with above, ~org-hugo-auto-export-mode~ will be enabled for
*all* Org files in the project. If you do not want that, see [[* Enable
only for an Org file]].
******* Enabling for multiple projects
To enable auto-exporting for multiple projects, simply add similar
=.dir-locals.el= files to the root directories of those projects. Just
ensure that the relative Org file directories, like the
/"content-org/"/ in above example, are set correctly.
****** Enable only for an Org file
Add below to the very-end of your Org file and *save the file*:
#+begin_src org
,* Footnotes
,* COMMENT Local Variables                          :ARCHIVE:
# Local Variables:
# eval: (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)
# End:
#+end_src
*About Footnotes*: Here I recommend adding the =* Footnotes=
 header[fn:5] too so that in case you add any Org footnotes, they go
 directly to that section you created. Otherwise, Org will auto-create
 a new /Footnotes/ heading *at the end of the file*.. and the /Local
 Variables/ heading would then no longer be at the end of the file.
****** Enable for the whole project except for few Org files
1. Enable the auto-exporting for the whole project as explained [[* Enable for the whole project][above]].
2. Then add below to the end of the Org file where you need to disable
   the auto-exporting:
   #+begin_src org
   ,* Footnotes
   ,* COMMENT Local Variables                          :ARCHIVE:
   # Local Variables:
   # eval: (org-hugo-auto-export-mode -1)
   # End:
   #+end_src
   Note that this time, =org-hugo-auto-export-mode= is disabled to
   override its enabled state in =.dir-locals.el=.

#+begin_note
After updating the state of =org-hugo-auto-export-mode= using either
of the above methods, remember to:
1. Save the Org file where you expect the auto-exporting to work.
2. Revert the buffer (~M-x revert-buffer~). That will ensure that the
   updated state for the =org-hugo-auto-export-mode= minor mode is
   effective.
#+end_note
**** Steps that /might/ need to be taken every time
Once the initial setup is done, the following steps apply to both
blogging flows.
***** Step {{{n}}}: Start the engines (Hugo Server)
We start the =hugo server= so that we can see the live-preview each
time the Org file is saved[fn:6].

Run below in your Hugo site root (the directory that contains the site
=config.toml=) to start the server:
#+begin_example
hugo server -D --navigateToChanged
#+end_example
***** Step {{{n}}}: Open your browser
By default the site is served locally on port /1313/ on
/localhost/. So the above step would have printed something like below
at the end:
#+begin_example
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
#+end_example

So open your favorite browser pointing to that address.
**** FINAL step that needs to be taken every time
***** Step {{{n}}}: Save and be in awe
If you are like me, you might not need to repeat steps 3 and 4 above,
as you can leave the =hugo= server running in a separate terminal, and
have a browser tab pinned to that localhost.

So with that, have the Emacs and browser frames set up side-by-side,
and edit your Org post.

Hit =C-x C-s= and be in awe as the browser auto-refreshes to the
*exact post you modified*!
*** Org Capture Setup
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: org-capture-setup
:END:
**** An Org Capture template
If you do not want to manually type the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= for each
new post, here is an example Org Capture template can help:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Populates only the EXPORT_FILE_NAME property in the inserted heading.
(with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
  (defun org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template ()
    "Returns `org-capture' template string for new Hugo post.
See `org-capture-templates' for more information."
    (let* ((title (read-from-minibuffer "Post Title: ")) ;Prompt to enter the post title
           (fname (org-hugo-slug title)))
      (mapconcat #'identity
                 `(
                   ,(concat "* TODO " title)
                   ":PROPERTIES:"
                   ,(concat ":EXPORT_FILE_NAME: " fname)
                   ":END:"
                   "%?\n")          ;Place the cursor here finally
                 "\n")))

  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
               '("h"                ;`org-capture' binding + h
                 "Hugo post"
                 entry
                 ;; It is assumed that below file is present in `org-directory'
                 ;; and that it has a "Blog Ideas" heading. It can even be a
                 ;; symlink pointing to the actual location of all-posts.org!
                 (file+olp "all-posts.org" "Blog Ideas")
                 (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template))))
#+end_src

Above capture will auto-insert a heading prefixed with =TODO=. With
=org-log-done= set to ='time=, on changing the =TODO= state to the
=DONE= state (=C-c C-t=), a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-Properties.html][/Special Property/]] called =CLOSED= will be
auto-inserted below the heading. Below is an example.
#+begin_example
,*** DONE Narrowing the Author column in Magit                       :org:log:
CLOSED: [2017-12-18 Mon 16:36]
#+end_example
=ox-hugo= auto-sets the =date= field in the front-matter to the time
stamp in that =CLOSED= property.
**** Alternative way: Export Hugo posts to a /Page Bundle/ organization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-capture-template-page-bundle
:END:
=ox-hugo= has /first-class/ support for the [[https://scripter.co/hugo-leaf-and-branch-bundles/][Page Bundles]] style of
content organization, introduced in Hugo v0.32.

If you prefer to have the exported posts to use the Page Bundles style
of content organization, define the same
=org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template= as below:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template ()
  "Returns `org-capture' template string for new Hugo post.
See `org-capture-templates' for more information."
  (let* ((title (read-from-minibuffer "Post Title: ")) ;Prompt to enter the post title
         (fname (org-hugo-slug title)))
    (mapconcat #'identity
               `(
                 ,(concat "* TODO " title)
                 ":PROPERTIES:"
                 ,(concat ":EXPORT_HUGO_BUNDLE: " fname)
                 ":EXPORT_FILE_NAME: index"
                 ":END:"
                 "%?\n")                ;Place the cursor here finally
               "\n")))
#+end_src
**** Alternative way to set the =date= field
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-capture-template-export-date
:END:
If you prefer to not insert time-stamps using the =DONE=-state
switching (i.e. you have =org-log-done= at its default value of
=nil=), you can explicitly insert the =EXPORT_DATE= property too using
the below definition of =org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template=
instead.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template ()

               "\n")))
#+end_src
*** Images in Content
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: images-in-content
:END:
Conventionally any static content for a Hugo site, like images, PDF
files, and other attachments are put in the site =static/=
directory. Files in that directory are served at the site root when
the Hugo publishes that site. So all the content in there can be
accessed using the root prefix =/=. So a =static/foo.png= file can be
accessed at =/foo.png=.

More detail for this conventional approach can be found in the
documentation for [[#references-to-files-in-the-static-directory][referencing files in static directory]].
**** Images and Regular Pages
OK, so with that short intro out of the way, =ox-hugo= supports
putting the /attachment files/ in the same directory as the source Org
files!

In the below example, the left hand side shows the Org content and
attachment file organization that the user would need to do
manually. And the right hand side shows the structure that =ox-hugo=
will generate in the =content/= and =static/= (the /conventional/ way
discussed above) directories.

#+begin_example
./content-org
├── images-in-content/
│  ├── images-in-content.org
│  │    * Post 1 (Org subtree)   →  ./content/images-in-content/post1.md
│  │    * Post 2 (Org subtree)   →  ./content/images-in-content/post2.md
│  ├── gnu.png                   →  ./static/ox-hugo/gnu.png
│  └── org.png                   →  ./static/ox-hugo/org.png
├── post3/
│  ├── post3.org                 →  ./content/images-in-content/post3.md
│  └── gnu-copy.png              →  ./static/ox-hugo/gnu-copy.png
└── post4/
   ├── post4.org                 →  ./content/images-in-content/post4.md
   └── org-copy.png              →  ./static/ox-hugo/org-copy.png
#+end_example

Have a look at the
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/main/test/site/content-org/images-in-content/images-in-content.org][=content-org/images-in-content/images-in-content.org=]] file for an
example of how to reference same-directory files (=gnu.png= and
=org.png= in this example) in an Org file (/Hint: Just as you would do
in a normal Org file/).

The benefit of this /same-directory-attachment/ approach is that you
don't need to use any directory prefix to reference those files
(example: =[[file:gnu.png]]=). When =ox-hugo= exports those posts though,
the images are auto-copied to the =static/ox-hugo/= directory[fn:1]
and =/ox-hugo/= prefix is added to those file references in the
exported Markdown files.

Also as the image file references are valid within the Org file, you
can see those images inline too!

***** Examples
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: images-and-regular-bundles-examples
:END:
Whether you prefer the subtree-based approach or file-based approach
for writing your posts in Org, there are examples for both in the
=ox-hugo= test suite:
- [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/main/test/site/content-org/images-in-content][Org source]]
- [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/tree/main/test/site/content/images-in-content][Exported Markdown]]
**** Images and Page Bundles
/See [[*Hugo Bundle][Hugo Bundle]] section on how to define those via ~ox-hugo~./

*Only for page bundles*, when a link points to a local attachment, and
the image path contains the hugo bundle name, following attachment
copying rules apply:
- Assume that the bundle is a /Leaf Bundle/ and its name is ~bundle-1~
  (~:EXPORT_HUGO_BUNDLE: bundle-1~) and that the image (attachment)
  path relative to the Org file is
  ~some-dir-1/bundle-1/some-dir-2/image.png~.
- The attachment's path relative to "bundle-1" is retained and copied
  to the "bundle-1" directory in the content dir. The /path before/
  the "bundle-1" in the attachment path is ignored.
- So after the export, we will see a directory structure like this in
  the content dir:
  #+begin_example
  ./content
  ..
   └── bundle-1
      ├── index.md
      └── some-dir-2/image.png
  #+end_example

#+begin_note
If the attachment path does _not_ contain the bundle name, it will be
copied as usual to the ~static/~ directory (See the documentation for
[[#references-to-files-in-the-static-directory][referencing files in static directory]]).
#+end_note
***** Examples
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: images-and-page-bundles-examples

*** Replace Front-matter Keys
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: replace-front-matter-keys
:END:
This is a =ox-hugo=-unique feature that allows you to replace any
front-matter key name to accommodate for your favorite Hugo theme.

#+hugo: more

The syntax is:

#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: oldkey1>newkey1 oldkey2>newkey2
#+end_src

or, if you want this to apply only for a specific Org tree:

#+begin_src org
:EXPORT_HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_KEY_REPLACE: oldkey1>newkey1 oldkey2>newkey2
#+end_src

Here are few use cases to better explain this feature.

- Note :: I use property drawers in the below examples (used in
          subtree-based flow). But the same would work for the Org
          keyword equivalents in file-based flow too.

**** Use =description= in Org file, but export as =summary=
The /Description/ meta-data is standard in Org.

Starting with *v0.55.0*, Hugo now supports ~summary~ as an inbuilt
front-matter variable to directly specify the post /summary/. See Hugo
commit [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/3a62d54745e2cbfda6772390830042908d725c71][3a62d547]] for details.

#+begin_note
~ox-hugo~ has also been supporting the ~description~ front-matter
variable. So support for the new ~summary~ front-matter variable,
which is essentially a duplicate of ~description~, is not added
explicitly.
#+end_note

As the ~summary~ parameter does not have explicit support in
~ox-hugo~, you would need to set it using the following property:

#+begin_src org
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :summary "Here is my post summary."
#+end_src

But instead, you can simply add this at the top of your Org file:

#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: description>summary
#+end_src

and then use ~description~ to do the same:

#+begin_src org
:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: Here is my post summary.
#+end_src

It gets even better if you use the {{{relref(*description* Org Special
Block,org-special-blocks#description)}}}:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_description
Here is my *post summary*.

And this can be over /multiple lines/ too!
,#+end_description
#+end_src

By doing above, you would be using /description/ in your Org source,
but that would get exported as /summary/ in the Markdown! :smile:
**** Use Org tags, but export as =keywords=
Here's another scenario.. you painstakingly set Org tags for all your
posts, and then you switch to a theme that calls refers to your =tags=
as =keywords= instead!

Captain =HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_KEY_REPLACE= is here to help you
again! :sunglasses:

Just add this at the top of your Org file:

#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: tags>keywords
#+end_src
**** Swap =tags= and =categories=
And one more example.. you call them /tags/, the Hugo theme calls them
/categories/, and vice-versa.

What do you do? ..

#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: tags>categories categories>tags
#+end_src
**** Removing front-matter keys during export
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: removing-keys
:END:
In the front-matter key replacement syntax:
#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: oldkey>newkey
#+end_src
If ~newkey~ is a special string *nil*, ~oldkey~ will be _removed_ from
the exported front-matter.

For example, if you want to remove the ~aliases~ front-matter from
your exported files (but want to leave them in your Org files), simply
add this to the top of your Org files:
#+begin_src org
#+hugo_front_matter_key_replace: aliases>nil
#+end_src
**** Examples
You can find a bunch of examples if you search for /"Replace
front-matter keys"/ in {{{ox-hugo-test-file}}}.
- Those examples are exported as {{{testtag(replace)}}}.
*** Org-Cite Citations
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: org-cite-citations
:END:
#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::*Org Cite Basic Example" :only-contents t

#+begin_note
The Ox-Hugo Pandoc Citation feature needs to be disabled for Org Cite
based citation processing to work.

So make sure that you don't have ~:EXPORT_HUGO_PANDOC_CITATIONS: t~ in
your post tree or ~#+hugo_pandoc_citations: t~ in your Org file!
#+end_note
**** Citation Processor: CSL
The [[https://citationstyles.org/][Citations Style Language]] (CSL) defines how the citations and
bibliographies should be exported.

Using CSL is optional, and dependent on an external package
[[https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el][~citeproc.el~]]. By default CSL is not enabled and the citations and
bibliographies will be exported to Markdown in plain text i.e. without
any emphasis, hyperlinking, etc.

To enable <<<CSL-formatted exports>>>:
1. Install ~citeproc~ from [[https://melpa.org/#/citeproc][Melpa]].
2. Add this to the top of your Org file: ~#+cite_export: csl~

That's it! The Org inbuilt library ~oc-csl.el~ will autoload
~citeproc~ when it sees that ~#+cite_export~ keyword. With CSL
processing enabled, the citations and bibliographies will now be
exported in HTML embedded in the exported Markdown files.

Check out the [[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html#using-csl][/This Month in Org/ -- July 2021]] post for more
information.
**** Auto-injecting /Bibliography/ heading
#+begin_mark
If CSL-formatted exports are enabled
#+end_mark
, a Markdown heading named "Bibliography" will be auto-inserted above
the /bibliography/ section. This section is exported if the Org file
has {{{relref(~#print_bibliography:~
keyword,#printing-bibliography)}}}.

This feature is controlled by the ~org-hugo-citations-plist~
property list variable.

This property list recognizes these properties:

- :bibliography-section-heading :: /(string)/ Heading to insert before
  the bibliography section.  The default value is "Bibliography". If
  this property is set to an empty string, the bibliography heading
  auto-injection is not done.

  Some users might choose to customize this value to
  "References". Here's an example of how that can be done in the Emacs
  config:
  #+name: code__customizing_bibliography_heading
  #+caption: Customizing bibliography heading
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'ox-hugo
    (plist-put org-hugo-citations-plist :bibliography-section-heading "References"))
  #+end_src
- :bibliography-section-regexp :: /(string)/ Regular expression to
  find the beginning of the bibliography section.  The default value
  is a regular expression that matches the ~<div
  class="csl-bib-body">~ HTML element exported by ~citeproc.el~.
*** Pandoc Citations
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: pandoc-citations
:END:
The [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] Citations are prefixed with the *@* character. If the
citation is ~@foo~, that particular /foo/ reference much be present in
one of the specified bibliography files.

#+begin_note
Users need to have the ~pandoc~ and ~pandoc-citeproc~ binaries[fn:7]
present in the ~PATH~.
#+end_note

When one or more citations are found by Pandoc, a top-level
"References" section with matching references is automatically added
at the very end of the post.
**** Enabling
Pandoc based citation parsing is enabled by setting the
~#+hugo_pandoc_citations:~ keyword or ~:EXPORT_HUGO_PANDOC_CITATIONS:~
subtree property to ~t~.

#+begin_note
If a post has neither [[* Nocite][~nocite~]] meta-data, nor valid citation keys
(~@foo~), the Pandoc parsing step is skipped *even if* the above
Pandoc Citations parsing option is enabled.
#+end_note
**** Bibliography
Bibliography files (~example.bib~) are specified using the
~#+bibliography:~ keyword or ~:EXPORT_BIBLIOGRAPHY:~ subtree
property. *It is mandatory to specify at least one bibliography file.*

Multiple comma-separated bibliography files can be
specified.

/Note that the path to these bibliography files is relative to the Org
file directory./
**** Nocite
~nocite~ is a special Pandoc-specific meta-data which can be used to
add extra citations even when they are not referenced in the post. It
is set like any other list-type custom front-matter parameter
(i.e. ~:LIST_PARAM '(ELEMENT1 ELEMENT2)~). See its example [[#pandoc-citations-example][below]].
**** Link citations
~link-citations~ is a special Pandoc-specific meta-data which, when
set to ~true~, enables linking of the citations in the post body to
the corresponding reference in the "References" section. It is set
like any other single-value custom front-matter parameter
(i.e. ~:LIST_PARAM VALUE~). See its example [[#pandoc-citations-example][below]].
**** Specifying Citation Style Language (CSL)
By default, Pandoc uses /Chicago Manual of Style author-date/ as the
[[https://citationstyles.org/][Citation Style Language]] ([[https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations][ref]]). This can be customized by using the
Pandoc-specific meta-data ~csl~ to specify the new CSL file. It is set
like any other single-value custom front-matter parameter
(i.e. ~:LIST_PARAM VALUE~). See its example [[#pandoc-citations-example][below]].

/Note that the path to the CSL file is relative to the Org file
directory./
**** Removal of Pandoc-specific meta-data
The Pandoc-specific meta-data mentioned above (~nocite~,
~link-citations~ and ~csl~) are auto-deleted from the front-matter in
the final Markdown file that's supposed to be used by Hugo.

Those meta-data were added using HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER *only for
Pandoc* to parse. Also there's no point leaking the user's
bibliography and CSL file paths in the front-matter to be processed by
Hugo.
**** Example

          to exist in the same directory containing that Org file.

{{{test-search(citations)}}}

Also see [[https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations][Pandoc Manual -- Citations]] for more details.
**** How Pandoc Citations work
1. ~ox-hugo~ first exports the Org file/subtree to a Markdown file as
   usual.
2. ~pandoc~ then expands the ~@foo~ citations in that file and
   *rewrites* the whole Markdown file from the AST parsed by it.
***** COMMENT
/Below caveat shouldn't apply now. Pandoc output seems to be pretty
much Blackfriday-compatiable now -- <2018-07-20 Fri>/

-----

/Mostly/ this would work fine.

But you might end up with issues if the /Blackfriday/ workarounds
implemented in ~ox-hugo~ exports get removed during the rewrite by
Pandoc.

To check if an issue you see is specific to Pandoc rewrites,
- temporarily set the ~HUGO_PANDOC_CITATIONS~ option to ~nil~,
- re-export using ~ox-hugo~, and
- check if Hugo renders the final HTML correctly after that.

If this original Markdown export is parsed fine by Hugo, open an Issue
with all the details (reproducible Org snippet, failing Markdown
output by Pandoc, etc.), and we can see if this is something that can
be fixed.

(Of course, open an issue whenever any ~ox-hugo~ export does not do
things as you expect :smile:)
*** Org-ref Citations

#+begin_note
<2022-02-10 Thu> Below instructions are out-dated. The [[https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-org][citeproc-org]]
package repository now mentions that the package is *obsolete* as
citation handling is now integrated into Org 9.5 in the new *oc.el*
library.
#+begin_quote
As native support for citations including CSL-based export is now part
of Org (see [[https://orgmode.org/list/87o8bcnfk9.fsf@nicolasgoaziou.fr/][the announcement]] and the relevant [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Citation-handling.html][manual section]]), and the
most recent org-ref version also supports CSL-formatting (see [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs59PGTfDC0][this
video]]), citeproc-org is obsolete and will be in maintenance mode
(reported bugs will be fixed), with only occasional backports from the
Org-native CSL infrastructure, which is under active development. The
recommended way of getting CSL-rendering of Org citations is therefore
using native Org cites with the CSL export processor or using [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref
3]].

*DEPRECATED*
#+end_center

[[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][Org-ref]] citations can be exported to Hugo-compatible markdown via the
[[https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-org][citeproc-org]] package. To enable this, simply install ~citeproc-org~
from Melpa, and run the setup hook. With ~use-package~, this looks
like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package citeproc-org
  :ensure t
  :after ox-hugo

  (citeproc-org-setup))

*** Custom Front-matter Parameters
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: custom-front-matter
:END:
#+begin_description
Setting custom front-matter parameters which have no special meaning
to Hugo, but are used in user's themes.
#+end_description

- To set a custom front-matter parameter in a subtree, use the
  ~:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER:~ property.
- To set a custom front-matter parameter globally or for /per-file/
  export flow, use the keyword ~#+hugo_custom_front_matter:~.

For the rest of this section, the /property/ method for setting the
custom front-matter will be used. But the same applies to the
/keyword/ method too (except for property-specific
~:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER+:~ syntax -- See ~(org) Property
Syntax~ for more).
**** Single value parameters
***** Syntax
#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :key1 value1 :key2 value2
:END:
#+end_src

Instead of appending all the key/value pairs on the same line, they
can instead be broken down as shown below, by appending ~+~ to the
property name.

#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :key1 value1
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER+: :key2 value2
:END:
#+end_src

If using the /keyword/ method instead, the same would be written as:
#+begin_src org
,#+hugo_custom_front_matter: :key1 value1
,#+hugo_custom_front_matter: :key2 value2
#+end_src

/The above method of appending keywords will work for the other cases
below too./
***** Example
#+begin_src org
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :feature true
:END:
#+end_src
Above exports to TOML front-matter as:
#+begin_src toml

#+end_src
**** Front-matter Extra
You would use this feature only if you need to use some front-matter
that ~ox-hugo~ cannot translate from native Org keywords/properties to
TOML/YAML front-matter. A good example is if you need to add custom
/map of map/ type front-matter (or TOML /tables of tables/).

The front-matter specified in this manner is appended *verbatim* to
the *end* of the ~ox-hugo~ generated front-matter.
***** TOML Extra front-matter
Create a *toml* Org source block anywhere in your post, and add the
special header args ~:front_matter_extra t~ to it.

/The TOML front-matter is the default. So you do not need to set
~:EXPORT_HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_FORMAT: toml~./
#+begin_src org
,* Post with TOML front-matter (default)
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: extra-front-matter-toml
:END:
The contents of the ~#+begin_src toml :front_matter_extra t~ TOML
block here will get appended to the TOML front-matter.
,#+begin_src toml :front_matter_extra t
[[foo]]
  bar = 1
  zoo = "abc"
[[foo]]
  bar = 2
  zoo = "def"
,#+end_src
#+end_src
***** YAML Extra front-matter
Create a *yaml* Org source block anywhere in your post, and add the
special header args ~:front_matter_extra t~ to it.

#+begin_src org
,* Post with YAML front-matter
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: extra-front-matter-yaml
:EXPORT_HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_FORMAT: yaml
:END:
The contents of the ~#+begin_src yaml :front_matter_extra t~ YAML
block here will get appended to the YAML front-matter.
,#+begin_src yaml :front_matter_extra t
foo:
  - bar: 1
    zoo: abc
  - bar: 2
    zoo: def
,#+end_src
#+end_src
***** Wrong format of extra front-matter
The ~:front_matter_extra t~ source block LANG *has* to match your
selected front-matter format.

You cannot have a ~#+begin_src yaml :front_matter_extra t~ extra
front-matter block if your front-matter format is YAML (and
vice-versa).

If that happens, that blocks gets exported neither to the Markdown
body nor to the front-matter.
**** More Examples
You can find many other examples by looking at {{{testtag(custom-fm)}}}.
*** Hugo Section
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: hugo-section
:END:
#+begin_description
Specifying the path under Hugo "content" to where the Markdown file
should be exported.
#+end_description
**** Default
By default, ~ox-hugo~ exports all the markdown files to
~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/posts/~.

The "posts" sub-directory default is set in the
~org-hugo-default-section-directory~ /defcustom/ variable which a user
can customize.

With the below Org file, the post will export to that "posts"
sub-directory:

#+begin_src org
,#+hugo_base_dir: .

,* My post
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-post
:END:
This gets created in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/posts/~.
#+end_src

Setting ~org-hugo-default-section-directory~ will affect
globally---All your ~ox-hugo~ exported projects.
**** Setting ~HUGO_SECTION~ per file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hugo-section-keyword
:END:
If you need to override the default ~HUGO_SECTION~ only in an Org
file, set the ~#+hugo_section~ keyword.
#+begin_src org
,#+hugo_base_dir: .
,#+hugo_section: articles

,* My post
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-post
:END:
This gets created in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/articles/~.
#+end_src
**** Setting ~HUGO_SECTION~ per subtree (only /per-subtree/ flow)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hugo-section-property
:END:
If you need to override *both* the default ~HUGO_SECTION~ and the Org
file specific ~#+hugo_section~ keyword, set the ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~
subtree property.
#+begin_src org
,#+hugo_base_dir: .
,#+hugo_section: articles

,* About
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: /
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: about
:END:
This gets created directly in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/~.
,* My post
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-post
:END:
This gets created in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/articles/~. As the
~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ property is not set, the ~#+hugo_section~
keyword value applies.
,* Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: notes
:END:
,** My note
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-note
:END:
This gets created in ~<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/notes/~.
#+end_src

The ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ does not need to be set in the same subtree
as the post.

The benefit of this is that you can have a parent subtree set the
~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ value, and then have all the children subtrees
inherit that value. See the "Notes" subtree in above example to see
this inheritance in action.
**** Section path fragments (only /per-subtree/ flow)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hugo-section-fragments
:END:
The default Org Property behavior is that the value of a property set
in the /closest parent/ wins. See the below example to understand
that.

#+name: code__using_only_EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION
#+caption: Using only ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~
#+begin_src org
,* Main section
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: main
:END:
The parsed value of ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ property is ~"main"~ here.
,** Sub section 1
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: sub
:END:
The parsed value of ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ property is ~"sub"~ here. The
earlier set ~"main"~ value in the parent of this subtree is lost.

I would have liked the parent value ~"main"~ to get auto-prepended here.
,** Sub section 2
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: main/sub
:END:
The parsed value of ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION~ property is ~main/sub~ here.

While this works, it gets a bit inconvenient to manually prefix the
parent property value (~"main/"~ here) as the number of nesting levels
increase.
#+end_src

But this is Emacs, and with the help of Emacs-Lisp and kind help from
/Ihor Radchenko/ on the [[https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-orgmode/2018-10/msg00002.html][Org mailing list]], ~ox-hugo~ now has a solution
to this!

#+begin_verse
>    /Introducing *~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~* (with that asterisk)/ :tada:
#+end_verse

If a subtree has the ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~ property set, it is
treated as a section path *fragment*. Such fragment properties will be
concatenated with the *same* fragment properties further up in the
parent hierarchy.

The collective concatenated value of ~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~ properties
is further prefixed with the value of the good old ~HUGO_SECTION~
keyword/property that's effective in that subtree.

#+begin_note
~EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*~ *has* to be set as a subtree property. There is
no Org keyword equivalent for this, because this property is designed
only for /per-subtree/ flow (and it makes sense only for this flow).
#+end_note

So the final *section path* looks like this:
#+begin_example
<HUGO_BASE_DIR>/content/<HUGO_SECTION>/<concatenated values of EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION*>/
                        └─────────────────────  section path  ──────────────────────┘
#+end_example

See the below example to get further clarity on this logic.

#+name: code__using_hugo_section_fragments

*** Inlined SVGs
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: inlined-svgs

Inlined SVGs are supported by a new HTML attribute introduced by
~ox-hugo~: *inlined*.

Just add ~#+attr_html: :inlined t~
#+begin_mark
above the SVG file link
#+end_mark
.

Here's an example of inlining an SVG:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src plantuml :file ../test/site/content-org/images/svg-with-hyperlinks.svg :exports results
skinparam svgLinkTarget _parent
start

,#+attr_html: :inlined t
,#+RESULTS:

#+end_src

.. which results in:

#+begin_src plantuml :file ../test/site/content-org/images/svg-with-hyperlinks.svg :exports results
skinparam svgLinkTarget _parent
start
:[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/ ox-hugo homepage]];

*** CJK Support
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: cjk-support
:EXPORT_HUGO_ALIASES: chinese-support japanese-support
:END:
**** Auto-unwrapping of lines with multi-byte characters
This issue came up on this [[https://emacs-china.org/t/ox-hugo-auto-fill-mode-markdown/9547][emacs-china thread]] .. the issue was that
when consecutive lines in Org source had Chinese characters, in HTML
the last character on one line got separated from the first character
on the next line by a space, which is not grammatically correct in
Chinese.

So in such cases, those lines must be unwrapped _without any spaces_
to separate those characters across the lines.

That of course would not be grammatically correct in English and even
other languages with multi-byte characters (few examples: Hindi,
Gujarati).

So that line-unwrapping _with space removal_ is done *only if*,
1. The /locale/ is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Environment-Variables.html][auto-detected]] to be Chinese or Japanese via
   environment variables /LANGUAGE/, /LC_ALL/ or /LANG/, or
2. The /locale/ is *manually set* to Chinese or Japanese by setting it
   to *zh* or *ja* using ~#+hugo_locale:~ keyword (or
   ~EXPORT_HUGO_LOCALE~ property).

#+end_description
To make an ~ox-hugo~ export happen to a Hugo Page Bundle, set the

#+begin_description
Special ~#+begin_..~ .. ~#+end_..~ constructs recognized by Ox-hugo.
#+end_description

**** HTML5 inline elements
Org special blocks created using the HTML tags defined in
~org-blackfriday-html5-inline-elements~ will export as inline HTML.

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_INLINETAG
something
,#+end_INLINETAG
#+end_src

will export as:

#+begin_src html
<INLINETAG>something</INLINETAG>
#+end_src

For example, ~mark~ is one of those inline elements. So,

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_mark
This sentence is marked.
,#+end_mark
#+end_src

will export as:

#+begin_src html
<mark>This sentence is marked.</mark>
#+end_src

and render as:

#+header: :trim-pre nil
#+begin_mark
This sentence is marked.
#+end_mark
**** HTML5 block elements
Org special blocks created using the HTML tags defined in
~org-html-html5-elements~ will export as HTML blocks wrapped by those
tags.

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_BLOCKTAG
something
,#+end_BLOCKTAG
#+end_src

will export as:

#+begin_src html
<BLOCKTAG>

  something

</BLOCKTAG>
#+end_src

For example, [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside][~aside~]] is one of those HTML5 block elements. So,

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_aside
Some content for the ~aside~ block.
,#+end_aside
We can even make the ~aside~ block /aside-like/ with
[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside][this little CSS]].
#+end_src

will export as:

#+begin_src html
<aside>

Some content for the `aside` block.

</aside>
We can even make the `aside` block _aside-like_ with
[this little CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside).
#+end_src

and render as:

#+begin_export html
<style>
  aside {
      width: 40%;
      padding-left: .5rem;
      margin-left: .5rem;
      float: right;
      box-shadow: inset 5px 0 5px -5px #29627e;
      font-style: italic;
      color: #29627e;
  }

  aside > p {
      margin: .5rem;
  }
</style>
#+end_export

#+begin_aside
Some content for the ~aside~ block.
#+end_aside
We can even make the ~aside~ block /aside-like/ with [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside][this little CSS]].
**** Details and Summary
~details~ is one of the HTML5 block elements, but it is treated
as a separate case because we also need to support the nested inline
~summary~ tag in there.

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_details
,#+begin_summary
This is summary.
,#+end_summary
Here are the details.
,#+end_details
#+end_src
See {{{relref(Details and Summary,details-and-summary)}}}.
**** HTML Attributes
HTML attributes can be added to the first /tag/ of any of the above
Special Blocks using the ~#+attr_html~ syntax. The ~class~ attribute,
for instance, is very handy.

For example, if we want the marked text to have red foreground color,
we can do:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_export html
<style>
  .red {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
,#+end_export
,#+attr_html: :class red
,#+begin_mark
This marked text's foreground is red.
,#+end_mark
#+end_src

#+begin_note
You may choose to have a CSS snippet like above either inline in the
exported Markdown, or in your website's CSS file.
#+end_note

and that will render as:
#+begin_export html
<style>
  .red {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
#+end_export
#+attr_html: :class red
#+begin_mark
This marked text's foreground is red.
#+end_mark
**** Description
The ~#+begin_description~ .. ~#+end_description~ special block can be
used to set the ~description~ front-matter variable.

This allows the description to be written in a well-formatted fashion
with Org markup and it can be multi-line too.

As an example:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_description
Here is my *post summary*.

And this can be over /multiple lines/ too!
,#+end_description
#+end_src

Above will export as this in the TOML front matter:
#+begin_src toml
description = """
  Here is my **post summary**.

  And this can be over _multiple lines_ too!
  """
#+end_src
**** Hugo Paired Shortcodes
See
{{{relref(~HUGO_PAIRED_SHORTCODES~,shortcodes/#hugo-paired-shortcodes)}}}.
**** Other Special Blocks (~div~ tags)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: special-blocks--div-tags
:END:
If the Special Block /tag/ used isn't found in
~org-blackfriday-html5-inline-elements~ or ~org-html-html5-elements~,
that block exports just as an HTML ~div~ block.

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_SOMETHING
Content inside something.
,#+end_SOMETHING
#+end_src

exports as:

#+begin_src html
<div class="SOMETHING">

Content inside something.

</div>
#+end_src

and renders as:

#+begin_something
Content inside something.
#+end_something

If we want to reuse the ~.red~ CSS rule defined [[*HTML Attributes][above]], we can type:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_red
This text will be in red.
,#+end_red
#+end_src

which will render as:

#+begin_red
This text will be in red.
#+end_red

/See the [[* Whitespace Trimming][Whitespace Trimming]] section if you need to export with
~<span>~ tags instead of ~<div>~ tags./
**** Raw Org contents
By default, the content inside the Org special blocks will have some
default processing done by the exporter -- Org entities like ~\sum~ will
be replaced by its HTML entity ~&sum;~, ~foo_{bar}~ will be replaced
with ~foo<sub>bar</sub>~, and so on.

But the user might want to keep the contents of the special block
as-as, in its raw form, for some special block types. If the user
wants to do this for a special block of the /type/ FOO:

#+name: code__example_special_block
#+caption: An example /special block/ of type /FOO/
#+begin_src org
,#+begin_FOO
Some content
,#+end_FOO
#+end_src

, they need to add ~("FOO" . (:raw t))~ to the customization variable
~org-hugo-special-block-type-properties~.

By default , ~("katex" . (:raw t))~ is added to this list. So when
using a special block like,

#+name: code__example_katex_special_block
#+caption: An example /special block/ of type /katex/
#+begin_src org
,#+begin_katex
E = -J \sum\_{i=1}^N s\_i s\_{i+1}
,#+end_katex
#+end_src

, the equation in the content of that special block: ~E = -J
\sum\_{i=1}^N s\_i s\_{i+1}~ will be exported to Markdown as-is.

As an another example, if you have a special block for the [[https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/][Mermaid
diagramming markup]], and you need to write special blocks like below
which has one of the HTML reserved characters (~>~),
#+name: code__example_mermaid_special_block
#+caption: An example /special block/ of type /mermaid/
#+begin_src org
,#+begin_mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start --> Stop
,#+end_mermaid
#+end_src

you will need to export the content of that shortcode in raw Org. To
do so, you can add something like this to your config:

#+name: code__example_update_raw_special_block_prop
#+caption: An example of updating a special block type's ~:raw~ property to ~t~
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'ox-hugo
  (add-to-list 'org-hugo-special-block-type-properties '("mermaid" . (:raw t))))
#+end_src
**** TikZJax
~ox-hugo~ supports exporting raw /tikz/ snippet to Markdown which can be
rendered to images using the [[https://tikzjax.com/][TikZJax]] project.

To use this feature, ensure that the /TikZJax/ scripts are loaded in
the HTML ~<head>~ (you will need to tweak your site's Hugo template
for that):

#+caption: Sourcing TikZJax scripts in HTML head
#+name: code__tikzjax_html_head
#+begin_src html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://tikzjax.com/v1/fonts.css">
<script src="https://tikzjax.com/v1/tikzjax.js"></script>
#+end_src

Then simply put /tikz/ snippets in the Org source like so:

#+caption: Example use of tikzjax special block
#+name: code__tikzjax_special_block_example
#+begin_src org
,#+begin_tikzjax
\draw (0,0) circle (1in);
,#+end_tikzjax
#+end_src

{{{test-search(tikzjax)}}}
**** Whitespace Trimming
The default whitespace trimming around exported Org Special Blocks can
be configured by setting the ~:trim-pre~ and ~:trim-post~ properties
for specific special block types in the
~org-hugo-special-block-type-properties~ customization variable.

- If ~:trim-pre~ is set to ~t~, whitespace before the block is
  removed.
- If ~:trim-post~ is set to ~t~, whitespace after the block is
  removed.

#+begin_note
For the types not specified in
~org-hugo-special-block-type-properties~, the default behavior is like
that of ~'(:trim-pre nil :trim-post nil)~.
#+end_note

Here's an example of specifying trimming options for a new special
block type "sidenote":

#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'ox-hugo
  (add-to-list 'org-hugo-special-block-type-properties '("sidenote" . (:trim-pre t :trim-post t))))
#+end_src

Here's an example of overriding properties for one of the types, say "mark":

#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'ox-hugo
  (setcdr (assoc "mark" org-hugo-special-block-type-properties) '(:trim-pre t :trim-post nil)))
#+end_src

Or, you can ~M-x customize-group~, select ~org-select-hugo~ and tweak
this variable in that UI.

The default values set this way can be overridden in the Org file by
using the ~#+header:~ keyword above the special blocks. Below examples
demonstrate the usage of this ~#+header~ keyword.

#+begin_note
If a special block tag is not recognized as an HTML block or inline
element, or as a Hugo shortcode, it defaults to exporting [[#special-blocks--div-tags][with ~<div>~
tags]]. But if either pre or post trimming options are detected for a
special block, it will export with ~<span>~ tags.
#+end_note

#+include: "../test/site/content-org/all-posts.org::* Whitespace trimming around special blocks" :only-contents t
*** Shortcodes
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: shortcodes
:EXPORT_OPTIONS: num:t
:EXPORT_HUGO_PAIRED_SHORTCODES: alert2
:END:
#+begin_description
Support for Hugo Shortcodes in Org source
#+end_description

#+begin_note
- Do _not_ use raw Hugo shortcodes in Org source.
- *{{< .. >}}* and *{{% .. %}}* are not legal Org syntax.
#+end_note

Ox-hugo will not officially support verbatim use of Hugo shortcodes in
Org source, like you would do in Hugo Markdown source. But here are
few ways how you can either mimic them or include them indirectly.

**** Org Special Blocks
With a little bit of CSS and {{{relref(Org Special
Blocks,org-special-blocks#other-special-blocks--div-tags)}}}, we can
mimic some of the Hugo Shortcodes in Org itself.

Here is some CSS inspired from the [[https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/shortcodes/#alert][Docsy theme's]] ~alert~ shortcode:

<<alert-css>>
#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
CSS for alert shortcode from Docsy theme
#+end_summary
#+begin_src css
.alert {
  position: relative;
  padding: 0rem 1rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  border: 1px solid transparent;
}

.alert-warning {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: #ed6a5a;
  border-width: 0 0 0 4px;
}

.alert-heading {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: #ed6a5a;
  weight: bold;
}
#+end_src
#+end_details

#+begin_export html
<style>
  .alert {
    position: relative;
    padding: 0rem 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    border: 1px solid transparent;
  }

  .alert-warning {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: #ed6a5a;
    border-width: 0 0 0 4px;
  }

  .alert-heading {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    color: #ed6a5a;
    weight: bold;
  }
</style>
#+end_export

With that CSS, and the below Org snippet:

#+begin_src org
,#+attr_html: :class alert-warning
,#+begin_alert
,#+begin_alert-heading
Warning
,#+end_alert-heading
This is a warning.
,#+end_alert
#+end_src

we get this:

#+attr_html: :class alert-warning
#+begin_alert
#+begin_alert-heading
Warning
#+end_alert-heading
This is a warning.
#+end_alert
**** ~HUGO_PAIRED_SHORTCODES~
The Org Special Blocks export paired Hugo Shortcodes for a special
block /tag/ that's added to the ~HUGO_PAIRED_SHORTCODES~ keyword.
***** Non-Markdown Shortcodes ({{< .. >}})
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: non-markdown-shortcodes
:END:
The content within these shortcodes is not parsed by the Hugo Markdown
parser. See [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#shortcodes-without-markdown][Hugo Doc -- Shortcodes Without Markdown]].

1. Use ~:EXPORT_HUGO_PAIRED_SHORTCODES: myshortcode~ property or
   ~#+hugo_paired_shortcodes: myshortcode~ keyword to let the Org
   Special Block parsing logic know that "myshortcode" tag needs to be
   exported as a paired shortcode.
2. Use the Org Special Block:
   #+begin_src org
   ,#+begin_myshortcode
   Something
   ,#+end_myshortcode
   #+end_src

Above will export as:
#+begin_src md
{{< myshortcode >}}
Something
{{< /myshortcode >}}
#+end_src
****** Shortcodes with positional arguments
If the Hugo shortcode accepts positional arguments, they need to be
specified using the ~#+attr_shortcode~ keyword.

For example,

#+begin_src org
,#+attr_shortcode: argval1 "arg val 2"
,#+begin_myshortcode
Something
,#+end_myshortcode
#+end_src

will export as:

#+begin_src md
{{< myshortcode argval1 "arg val 2" >}}
Something
{{< /myshortcode >}}
#+end_src
****** Shortcodes with named arguments
~#+attr_shortcode~ keyword can be used to also specify a shortcode's
/named/ arguments.

For example,

#+begin_src org
,#+attr_shortcode: :arg1 foo bar :arg2 color: red; text-align: center;
,#+begin_myshortcode
Something
,#+end_myshortcode
#+end_src

will export as:

#+begin_src md
{{< myshortcode arg1="foo bar" arg2="color: red; text-align: center;" >}}
Something
{{< /myshortcode >}}
#+end_src
***** Markdown Shortcodes ({{% .. %}})
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: markdown-shortcodes
:END:
#+begin_note
All of the above applies to Markdown Shortcodes as well.
#+end_note

The content within these shortcodes *is* parsed by the Hugo Markdown
parser. See [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#shortcodes-with-markdown][Hugo Doc -- Shortcodes With Markdown]].

Only the syntax for specifying these shortcodes is different --- You
need to prefix the shortcode with ~%~.

Example: ~:EXPORT_HUGO_PAIRED_SHORTCODES: %myshortcode~ in the
post subtree's property drawer or ~#+hugo_paired_shortcodes:
%myshortcode~ as a keyword.
***** ~alert2~ shortcode example
An ~alert2~ shortcode definition is saved to this site's
~layouts/shortcodes/alert2.html~ which looks like this:
#+begin_src html
<div class="alert alert-{{ .Get 0 }}">
    {{ .Inner }}
</div>
#+end_src

~:EXPORT_HUGO_PAIRED_SHORTCODES: alert2~ is added to this post's
subtree in Org source so that the Org Special Block parser knows to
treat that /tag/ differently (i.e. export as a non-Markdown Hugo
shortcode).

With that, this Org snippet:

#+begin_src org
,#+attr_shortcode: warning
,#+begin_alert2
This is a warning.
,#+end_alert2
#+end_src

exports as:

#+begin_src md
{{< alert2 warning >}}
This is a warning.
{{< /alert2 >}}
#+end_src

and renders as this:

#+attr_shortcode: warning
#+begin_alert2
This is a warning.
#+end_alert2

/You might notice that the same [[alert-css][Alert CSS]] from the previous section is
applied here too./
**** Quoting Hugo-specific exports
The Org source should contain only Org syntax text which could be
parsed in general by any of the in-built Org exporters.

So ~ox-hugo~ does not recommend or support using raw Hugo shortcodes
directly in Org source as shown below:

#+begin_src md
# Bad !!
{{< alert2 warning >}}
This is a warning.
{{< /alert2 >}}
#+end_src

But many times, one might also want to use one of the unpaired Hugo
shortcodes like [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/#use-ref-and-relref][~relref~]]. These too, you cannot directly inline them
but you can use one of these methods.
***** ~@@hugo:..@@~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: inline-syntax
:END:
#+begin_src org
This links to the @@hugo:[Org Special Blocks]({​{< relref "org-special-blocks" >}})@@ page.
#+end_src

Above renders to:

This links to the @@hugo:[Org Special Blocks]({{< relref
"org-special-blocks" >}})@@ page.

See the [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Quoting-HTML-tags][HTML Export inline syntax]] for reference.

/Using ~@@md:..@@~ or ~@@html:..@@~ will also export the same way./
***** ~#+hugo:~ Keyword
Sometimes, it might also be possible to export the whole line in the
specified backend like so:

#+begin_src org
,#+hugo: This links to the [Org Special Blocks]({​{< relref "org-special-blocks" >}}) page.
#+end_src

Above renders to:

#+hugo: This links to the [Org Special Blocks]({{< relref "org-special-blocks" >}}) page.

/Using ~#+md:..~ or ~#+html:..~ will also export the same way./
***** ~#+begin_export hugo~
#+begin_note
This method is discouraged because we would then end up with Org text
with a lot of content which can be exported for only Hugo consumption!
#+end_note

The earlier sections {{{relref(Org Special
Blocks,#org-special-blocks)}}} and {{{relref(Hugo Paired
Shortcodes,#hugo-paired-shortcodes)}}} are the recommended methods if
you really want to blend Hugo shortcodes with your Org source.

Even though discouraged, this method is being documented for the sake
of completeness.

#+begin_src md
,#+begin_export hugo
{{< alert2 warning >}}
This is a warning.
{{< /alert2 >}}
,#+end_export
#+end_src

renders as:

#+begin_export hugo
{{< alert2 warning >}}
This is a warning.
{{< /alert2 >}}
#+end_export
**** Org Macros
If you find yourself using the [[#inline-syntax][~@@hugo:..@@~ Inline Syntax]] a lot, you
might appreciate the power of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Macro-Replacement.html][Org Macros]].

This is best shown using the same ~relref~ shortcode example ..

Instead of always typing ~@@hugo:[Org Special Blocks]({​{< relref
"org-special-blocks" >}})@@~, you can define an Org macro called
~relref~ like so:

#+begin_src md
,#+macro: relref @@hugo:[@@ $1 @@hugo:]({{< relref "$2" >}})@@
#+end_src

And then,

#+begin_src org
This links to the {{{relref(Org Special Blocks,org-special-blocks)}}} page.
#+end_src

will also render to:

This links to the {{{relref(Org Special Blocks,org-special-blocks)}}} page.
*** HTML Containers
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: html-containers
:END:
#+begin_description
Support ~HTML_CONTAINER~ and ~HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS~ similar to the way
~ox-html~ does, but also supporting property inheritance.
#+end_description
The ~HTML_CONTAINER~ and ~HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS~ properties can be
added to any of the subtrees with the ~EXPORT_~ prefix.

If a sub-tree has the property ~EXPORT_HTML_CONTAINER: section~, that
sub-tree is exported as a heading surrounding with ~<section>~ and
~</section>~. By default, that ~section~ tag has the class
"outline-NUM" where /NUM/ is the level of that heading in that post.

Additionally, if it has the property ~EXPORT_HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS:
foo~, the "foo" class gets added to that container tag as well.

{{{test-search(container)}}}
*** Anchors
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: anchors
:END:
#+begin_description
Anchors derived for sub-heading and other HTML elements in a page.
#+end_description
Hugo supports specifying custom ID's for headings in a page using the
~{#some-id}~ syntax. See its documentation on [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/#heading-ids][Cross References:
Heading IDs]] for reference.

If the heading ID's are not specified using the above syntax, Hugo
will generate them automatically. While that is OK in general, it
becomes problematic when user generates [[* Table of Contents][TOC]] using Org, where the links
to headings on the page need to be embedded, or uses Org internal or
external links to reference other headings.

So in order to make the user experience smooth, anchors for all
headings are always derived withing ~ox-hugo~ and exported using the
~{#some-id}~ syntax.

The functions used for deriving the anchors can be customized using
the *~org-hugo-anchor-functions~* variable.

This variable is a list of functions which can return the anchor
string for a given Org heading element. The first function in the list
to return a non-nil value wins. So this scheme can be used to set a
precedence order that the user desires.

This is the default precedence order:

- ~org-hugo-get-custom-id~ :: Use the heading's ~:CUSTOM_ID~ property
  if set, else return /nil/.
- ~org-hugo-get-heading-slug~ :: Derive anchor using the heading's
  text. This could also return /nil/, if the heading has no
  alphanumeric characters or no text (empty string).
- ~org-hugo-get-md5~ :: Derive anchor using the few 6 characters of
  /md5/ based on the heading title text. It returns the /md5/ of an
  empty string if nothing else works. That way, this function
  guarantees to return some non-empty string.

Above precedence is set in the default value of
~org-hugo-anchor-functions~ --- ~'(org-hugo-get-custom-id
org-hugo-get-heading-slug org-hugo-get-md5)~.
**** Other anchor functions
- ~org-hugo-get-id~ :: This function returns the ID, if that property
  is set for a heading.

  If a user prefers to give higher precedence to Org ID than the
  heading-derived-slug, they can customize ~org-hugo-anchor-functions~
  to ~'(org-hugo-get-custom-id org-hugo-get-id
  org-hugo-get-heading-slug org-hugo-get-md5)~.

  Now if an Org heading looks like this:

  #+begin_src org
  ,** Heading in a post
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       74283e7c-a20b-1c22-af88-e41ff8055d17
  :END:
  #+end_src

  , it will be exported as below in Markdown:

  #+begin_src md
  ### Heading in a post {#74283e7c-a20b-1c22-af88-e41ff8055d17}
  #+end_src

** COMMENT v
*** Features
*** Backward-incompatible changes
*** Fixes
*** Meta
** v0.8 <2018-01-26 Fri>
*** Features
- Support exporting content files and attachments (images, documents)
  to Page Bundles organization structure (Hugo v0.32+) --
  {{{issue(111)}}}.
- Support exporting =resources= front-matter (Hugo v0.33+) --
  {{{issue(115)}}}.
- Support exporting =headless= front-matter (Hugo v0.35+).
- Advanced table styling is now possible by specifying =#+attr_html=
  and =#+attr_css= (this one is unique to =ox-hugo=) above Org
  tables. See its [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/table-styling/][documentation]] -- {{{issue(93)}}}.
  - Similarly, support =#+attr_html= and =#+attr_css= for paragraphs,
    example blocks, source blocks, plain lists and quote blocks too --
    {{{issue(113)}}}.
- Now =publishDate= front-matter property gets
  auto-derived from the =SCHEDULED= special property if
  associated with the valid Hugo post subtree --
  {{{commit(0807f42d)}}}.
  - Date values can now be easily set using the =C-c .= binding in the
    =HUGO_PUBLISHDATE= and =HUGO_EXPIRYDATE= properties too.
- Export source blocks and table captions -- {{{issue(38)}}}. Here's a
  suggested CSS for the captions:
  #+begin_src css
  figcaption,
  .src-block-caption,
  .table-caption {
      font-style: italic;
      text-align: center;
  }
  #+end_src
- Export descriptive or definition lists in Blackfriday-friendly
  Markdown format -- {{{issue(114)}}}.
- Support Org Special Blocks like in HTML and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Special-blocks-in-LaTeX-export.html][LaTeX exports]] --
  {{{issue(105)}}}. Here's one little example:
  #+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_mark
  /Some/ *marked* text
  ,#+end_mark
  #+end_src
- Allow setting =:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION:= in the valid Hugo post subtree
  itself.
- Enable replacing any key in the front-matter with anything; it's
  even possible to swap the keys now (tags↔categories:
  {{{commit(fb21e82c)}}}). New keyword:
  =HUGO_FRONT_MATTER_KEY_REPLACE= -- see {{{commit(b72a5fb0)}}}.
- Now all the Org keyword values that should get merged, get merged --
  {{{commit(38eba6d5)}}}.
- Add =title= as a valid property of =menu= front-matter (Hugo
  v0.32+).
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- A "better user-experience" change.. now you do not need to use
  /double-underscores/ as /space/ replacement in =#+hugo_tags=,
  =#+hugo_categories= and =#+keywords=. See this commit for details
  and examples -- {{{commit(319435db)}}}.
*** Fixes
- Fix =HUGO_LEVEL_OFFSET= not getting set -- {{{issue(117)}}}, thanks
  {{{user(shimmy1996)}}}!
- Fix internal subtree counter not getting reset after a file-based
  export.
- Fix clickable image links with =#+name= -- {{{commit(fef0ec50)}}}.
- Make title text rendering more robust.. now Markdown markup
  characters like =*=, =_= and =`= show up fine, verbatim, in the
  title.
- Make em dash, en dash, horizontal ellipsis render in post titles
  too -- {{{hugoissue(4175)}}} (/Upstream bug fix/), and in source
  block captions and table captions too.
- Fix double-escaping of =#= and =![= in Markdown export --
  {{{issue(110)}}} (/fix in upstream =ox-md.el=/).
*** Meta
- Re-write the logic for parsing meta-data for various kinds of dates,
  and optimize the logic for parsing newline separated lists like tags
  and categories.
- The =hugo-bare-min-theme= used for the test site is made more
  portable (at some point, that theme might be moved to a separate
  repo).
** v0.7 <2017-12-18 Mon>
*** Features
- *Now C-c C-e H H works for both per-subtree and per-file flows* --
  {{{commit(b1b5d28b)}}}.
- Support Org heading based internal links -- {{{issue(88)}}}.
- Support list values for custom front-matter variables --
  {{{issue(99)}}}.
- Support specifying multiple [[https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/][hugo output formats]] .. Now the =outputs=
  front-matter variable is a list.
- Support the Org =#+author= and =#+creator= keywords and their
  respective Org Export Options -- {{{issue(106)}}}.
- Support Org Export Snippets and Export Blocks --
  {{{commit(1149f20cd)}}}.
- Now post titles can be set to =nil= i.e. be not be a part of the
  front-matter .. /because you can/.
- Improve the messages printed by =ox-hugo= on doing per-subtree or
  per-file exports.. the progress of files exported using per-subtree
  flow is now clearer, and the name of the file exported using
  per-file flow is now explicit.. Helps when you batch export a dozen
  files with a mix of these 2 flows.
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Obsolete /org-hugo-export-subtree-\ast{}/ functions and replace them with
  /org-hugo-export-wim-\ast{}/ (What I Mean) functions. See the doc string
  of =org-hugo-export-wim-to-md= for details.

  If you are using the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving/][Auto-export on saving]] flow, note the function
  name change there too!
*** Fixes
- Fix number of backticks in code fence when code contains code fence
  (/pathological corner case/).
- Better document the =HUGO_CODE_FENCE= keyword -- {{{issue(102)}}}.
- Don't render =(c)=, =(r)=, =(tm)= inside Latex equations --
  {{{issue(104)}}} (/Upstream bug workaround/).
- Better recognition of TOML-compatible integers and floats in meta
  data for front-matter so that valid integers/floats don't get
  unnecessarily double-quoted.
*** Meta
- Add a [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-debugprint/blob/master/layouts/partials/debugprint.html][=debugprint.html=]] partial to help pretty-print various Hugo
  objects like Page Params, File and SiteInfo for debug on the test
  site.
- The test site now has [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/tags/][tags]] and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/categories/][categories]] pages.
- Add few real world example posts containing complex Latex equations:
  [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/real-examples/multifractals-in-ecology-using-r/][1]], [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/real-examples/nn-intro/][2]].
- Turns out =ox-hugo= works on emacs 24.4 too (/but please upgrade
  to the latest Emacs and Org stable versions!/).
** v0.6 <2017-11-09 Thu>
*** Features
- Support the =num= export option. Now you can prefix all post
  headings (or some not.. the ones with =UNNUMBERED= property set to
  =t=) with their section numbers -- {{{issue(76)}}}.
- Org TOC's are now exported as unordered Markdown lists. This allows
  having TOC's with unnumbered headings too! This also enables
  prefixing the section headings with their full section numbers, and
  also having only selected headings unnumbered (both in the post body
  and the TOC).
- Add support for exporting internal links to source blocks, tables
  and images by their block names! -- {{{issue(29)}}}.
- Org table column alignment markers (=<l>=, =<r>=, =<c>=) are now
  exported to equivalent Markdown tables.. so a center-aligned column
  in Org buffer will remain center-aligned in the final HTML too! --
  {{{issue(95)}}}.
- Allow setting multiple Hugo aliases for a post. Also infer the
  section name from inherited =HUGO_SECTION= values (subtree-based
  exports) for those alias prefixes.
- Prevent a footnote ref to appear by itself on a newline (based on
  wrapping) in the browser -- {{{issue(96)}}}.
- If Hugo shortcodes are used specifically in Markdown (=md=) source
  blocks, they will be auto-escaped (useful when you want to
  document/talk about some Hugo shortcode in a blog post) --
  {{{issue(94)}}}.
- If an Org table has just 1 row, don't make it render as a header row
  in the final HTML.
- If you have a case where you need to have an Org source block
  instead a quote block, and then a source block after that quote
  block (/I know, a very common case../ :wink:), Blackfriday barfs
  ({{{bfissue(407)}}}). But we now have a workaround, which /just
  works/ -- {{{issue(98)}}}.
- Now =ATTR_HTML= above even hyper-linked images works (earlier it
  worked only above non-hyper-linked images).
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Org TOC's are exported as unordered Markdown lists instead of
  ordered Markdown lists, and now full section numbers (like 1.2.3)
  are shown in the TOC instead of just the last digit (like 3.) --
  {{{commit(4be378e7)}}}.
- The =num= Org export option is default to =nil= (only for
  =ox-hugo=). So Org TOC's are exported without section numbers by
  default. To get section numbers, set =num= to =t= or =onlytoc=.
*** Fixes
- Now exporting 1-row Org tables works too.
- Add missing http/https/ftp prefix for hyper-linked images.
*** Meta
- Add documentation on how you can have
  {{{doc(images-in-content,,Images live in the same directory as Org
  source)}}} -- {{{issue(91)}}}.
- Now only Org files for the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][documentation site]] need to be committed
  to git. =ox-hugo= then exports those to Markdown, and then Hugo
  publishes those to HTML (as before) --- all on Netlify.
- Be sure to check out the moderately revamped [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/test/][Test Site]]. That might
  be of interest even if you want to check out what the new features
  and changes look like, without first installing/updating =ox-hugo=
  yourself :smile:.
** v0.5 <2017-11-06 Mon>
*** Features
- Export TOC as a Markdown ordered list. See {{{doc(org-toc,,Table of
  Contents)}}} -- {{{issue(88)}}}.
- =#+attr_html= above http/https/ftp links is now supported (useful
  for specifying the =target=, =rel=, attributes, for example).
** v0.4.1 <2017-10-29 Sun>
*** Features
- Support specifying the =:height= parameter in the =#+attr_html=
  above image links. That eventually gets transformed to the =height=
  parameter in the =figure= tag in the HTML generated by Hugo. This
  feature requires building Hugo from its master branch with commit
  [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/commit/488631fe0abc3667355345c7eb98ba7a2204deb5][488631fe]] (or Hugo v0.31+).
*** Fixes
- Fix =EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION= not getting inherited {{{issue(90)}}}.
** v0.4 <2017-10-28 Sat>
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Restore the default Org behavior of =#+tags=. Now that keyword (and
  the =EXPORT_TAGS= property) is *not* used by =ox-hugo=. Fixes
  {{{issue(89)}}}.
- File-based exports must now use =#+hugo_tags= to set the post tags.
- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_TAGS= property to
  override Org-style tags on the same heading (and the ones inherited
  from Org-style tags from any of the parent subtrees and
  =#+filetags=).
  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+filetags= can be used to
    set tags globally in the file. Earlier =#+tags= was used for that
    purpose.
- Subtree-based exports can use the =EXPORT_HUGO_CATEGORIES= property
  to override Org-style categories (tags with "@" prefix) on the same
  heading (and the ones inherited from Org-style categories from any
  of the parent subtrees and =#+filetags=).
  - Note that for subtree-based exports, =#+filetags= can be used to
    set categories (tags with "@") globally in the file.

See the new section added to documentation:
{{{doc(tags-and-categories,,*Tags and Categories*)}}}
*** Features
- Support specifying the =:width= parameter in the =#+attr_html= above
  image links. That eventually gets transformed to the =width=
  parameter in the =figure= tag in the HTML generated by Hugo.
** v0.3.2 <2017-10-24 Tue>
*** Fixes
- Fix issue with heading metadata parsing (ALLTAGS, CLOSED, TODO)
  when a post Org heading was immediately followed by that post's
  sub-heading.  This issue was seen in subtree-based exports
  {{{issue(87)}}}.
** v0.3.1 <2017-10-19 Thu>
*** Fixes
- Fix the source block line number annotation when the line numbers
  increased in number of digits in the same code block.
** v0.3 <2017-10-18 Wed>
*** Features
- Source blocks can now be exported with line numbers and/or
  highlighting!

  See {{{doc(source-blocks,,Source Blocks)}}} for details.
** v0.2.3 <2017-10-11 Wed>
*** Fixes
- =org-hugo-slug= earlier stripped off only the =code= HTML tag
  (~<code> .. </code>~) from the input string, if present. Now it does
  that for *any* HTML tag, like =span=. For example, this HTML gets
  stripped off from the above heading (only inside =org-hugo-slug=
  when deriving the slug string): ~<span
  class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2017-10-11
  Wed&gt;</span></span>~.
** v0.2.2 <2017-10-10 Tue>
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Now =ox-hugo= by default requires text, to be sub/super-scripted, to
  be wrapped in ={}=. So now =a_b= will be exported as =a_b=, but
  =a_{b}= will be exported as =a<sub>b</sub>=. To revert back to the
  earlier behavior, user needs to add =#+options: ^:t= to their Org
  file.
** v0.2.1 <2017-09-28 Thu>
*** Fixes
- Single column tables now export correctly {{{issue(84)}}}.
- Ignore =HUGO_WEIGHT= set to =auto= for /per-file/ exports
  {{{issue(83)}}}.
** v0.2 <2017-09-27 Wed>
*** Features
- Add support for all Hugo =figure= shortcode parameters
  {{{issue(79)}}}.
- New option =org-hugo-delete-trailing-ws= defaults to =t=; now Hugo
  deletes trailing white-spaces by default.
- New options =org-hugo-default-static-subdirectory-for-externals= and
  =org-hugo-external-file-extensions-allowed-for-copying= (related to
  {{{issue(69)}}}).
*** Fixes
- Remove =HUGO_STATIC_IMAGE= option; fix attachment re-write
  {{{issue(69)}}}.
- Fix incorrectly inserted hard line-breaks {{{issue(72)}}}. Added a
  new option =HUGO_PRESERVE_FILLING=.
- Fix error happening when a post title was set to an empty string
  [ [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/ba9e8365f6ee42f030ed806bf5ec42d6acce4c76][ba9e8365]] ].
*** Backward-incompatible changes
- Switch the default value of =org-hugo-use-code-for-kbd= option to
  =nil= [ [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/commit/88ba15ae9bc809b0983315446c88fecfda3534e5][88ba15ae]] ].
** v0.1.3 <2017-09-13 Wed>
- Now a HUGO key value set to ="nil"=, like =#+hugo_code_fence: nil=,
  will evaluate as /nil/ instead of /t/, as now
  =org-hugo--plist-get-true-p= is used to parse boolean keys instead
  of =plist-get=.
** v0.1.2 <2017-09-12 Tue>
- Make DateTime matching better; new internal variable
  =org-hugo--date-time-regexp=. Earlier time zones ahead of UTC (with
  =+= sign) were not detected as dates in =org-hugo--quote-string= and
  thus were unnecessarily quoted.
** v0.1.1 <2017-09-11 Mon>
- Use CLOSED log drawer info if available to set the date in
  front-matter {{{issue(68)}}}.
- Code optimization: Use of =org-entry-get= at places instead of
  maintaining global variables.
* Footnotes

[fn:8] The [[https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#local-date-time][TOML date-time]] uses the same RFC3339 format.

[fn:7] The Pandoc Citations feature was last tested on
<2019-01-03 Thu> with Pandoc version {{{pandoc_version}}}. If you are
running an older version, the quickest way to install might be to
simply download the latest release archive from [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases][Pandoc releases]],
extract it and put the ~pandoc~ and ~pandoc-citeproc~ binaries in one
of the directories in your /PATH/.

[fn:6] If you are still using a Hugo version older than 0.25, update
now! -- Because that version added support for the awesome
=--navigateToChanged= switch.

[fn:5] I am assuming that the value of ~org-footnote-section~ in your
Emacs setup is the default value ~"Footnotes"~. If it's not, change
the "Footnotes" heading in that example accordingly.

[fn:4] The ~TODO~ / ~DONE~ keyword is used in this example as they are
the defaults in ~org-todo-keywords~. If you have customized your
~org-todo-keywords~, or are customizing them using other means like
the per-file ~#+seq_todo~ setting, use those instead. Use your custom
"DONE" keyword (it should be a part of ~org-done-keywords~) instead of
the default ~DONE~. And similarly, use your custom "TODO" keyword
instead of the default ~TODO~ (ensure that it is *not* in
~org-done-keywords~).

[fn:3] This requires MathJax. [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-bare-min-theme/blob/master/layouts/partials/mathjax.html][Here]] is a MathJax configuration that is
tested to work for equation referencing (referencing =\label{}=
labeled equations using =\ref{}=). The same is used on the =ox-hugo=
test site too.

[fn:2] For only subtree-based exports, you can set that special tag as
Org style tags too. Example: ~* I don't want to export this post
:no_no_dont_export:~.. and don't forget to add that tag to
=org-export-exclude-tags= too!

[fn:1] To understand why the attachment files get copied to the
=static/ox-hugo/= directory, have a look at the documentation for
{{{doc(image-links,#references-to-files-outside-the-static-directory,referencing
files outside static directory)}}}.
